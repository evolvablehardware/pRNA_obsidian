update on progress from Allyn

It does not appear to be a need for hardware solutions at this time
Jason will work on the report deliverable (week 2)

Allyn should setup meeting with Logan once BRAM M.V.P. is ready
On a future Tuesday meeting we should discuss design for interfacing the memory controller with the Vivum Neural Array
