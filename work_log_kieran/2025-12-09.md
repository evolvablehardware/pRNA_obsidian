## Log
- Researched methods of obtaining data from labrador
- There is no pre-made python api for the labrador
- The packets are simple and only contain the samples. no processing is done on the labrador
- Researched methods of calculating fitness in frequency domain
- Can use FFT to create small bins (~10HZ?) to analyze
- Could analyze:
	- SNR
	- difference between peak bin and desired
	- 
- Mateo set up the start of the python to interact with the labrador
## Next
- Create concrete code for FFT and fitness calculations
- Implement calibration into the labrador python code
