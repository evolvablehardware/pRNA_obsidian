## Log
- Tested generated PIO pulse counting code. It worked fairly well up to ~54.5kHz but past then there was no more serial output.
- We tried using the generated interrupt based c++ code but were having trouble getting serial coms to work.
- We tried pulse counting code found online that uses uPython with PIO to see if it would be better. Here is the link to the post where we found it: [link](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=307715#p1841265)
- The code is able to work at frequencies up to 10MHz. That's the highest frequency we can test with the Digilent Waveform Board. The code is in attachments as PIOPulseCounter.py
## Next
- I want to test the accuracy with a lab function generator.
