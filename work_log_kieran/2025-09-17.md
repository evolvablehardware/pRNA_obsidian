## Log
-  Set up Obsidian
-  Set up VSCodium/picoSDK/udev rules
-  Tested blink script: works
-  Created project for software based pulse counting
-  Flashed micropython firmware to board
- A quick test using a digilent waveform board as a function generator shows the software counting is accurate up to about 10kHz after making no modifications to the generated code except fixing where "global" was used while already in global scope.
## Next
-  Make sure there are no software bugs
-  Thorough test of accuracy
-  Try generated PIO based pulse counter
