## Log
- I tried to get the esp32 pulse counter I used last year working again as its fare more accurate than the arduino
- For some reason it kept reporting that it didn't count any pulses. I looked over the code and tested multiple pins but couldn't fix the issue. My source for testing was another esp32. I checked the signal on an oscilloscope and it looked good.
- I wonder if something with the library pcnt uses changed. There was a big change last year and stuff broke which took a while to fix. I'm thinking I should just swich to a pi-pico with PIO since that should be more useful in the long run anyhow. 
## Next
- Find out if I should make pulse counting code for pi-pico
