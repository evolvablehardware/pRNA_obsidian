## Jackson
- Ice Farm works!
- Demo with clocked pulse count seed circuit created with Verilog
- Jackson asks how to create I/O connections without Verilog
	- Can manually set bits in tile

## Thomas
- Looked into FileBasedCircuit file I/O
- Concerned about inconsistent mmap and file write usage
- Should be negligible once we move to Picos

## Kieran
- Soldered Picos for Jackson's new evolution strategy.
