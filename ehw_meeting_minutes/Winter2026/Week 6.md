**Thomas:**
- Able to get evolution working on Pico with Arduino.
- Simple varmax shows it was gaining fitness.

**Jackson:**
- On-board evaluation working
- Able to run experiments intrinsically with on-board evaluation
- Able to do multi-pico experiments
- 20-second epochs with 3 picos (!)

**Next week:** Jackson will demo his setup, we will start to run experiments if we can all replicate his success.
