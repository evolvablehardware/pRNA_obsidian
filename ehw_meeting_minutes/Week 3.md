## Documentation

- The group discussed the Obsidian document.
    - Agreement that documenting problems and solutions during experiments would be helpful.
    - Suggested creating a guide from notes and shared troubleshooting logs.
## Communication Tools

- Discussion on Slack vs Teams:
    - Some preferred Slack because of better notifications and huddles.
    - Others noted the group is already on Teams, and no strong reason to switch emerged.
    - Consensus: continue using Teams for meetings, but post troubleshooting notes in Slack so there’s a searchable history.
- Plan: install tools, run experiments, and post issues on Slack for collaborative troubleshooting.

## Research / Technical Discussion

- Hardware configuration was reviewed, including FPGA setup differences.
- Issues reported with flashing Pico firmware:
    - Solution was enabling a Python environment.
- Repository status: ongoing contributions and need for consistency.
- Emphasis on experimental workflow and ensuring reproducibility across setups.

## Next Steps

- Ensure all team members can successfully run the basic FPGA examples.
- Document errors and fixes encountered during setup.
- Create a shared guide from Slack troubleshooting threads.
- Continue coordinating through Teams for scheduled meetings.

## General Discussion

- Agreement that reviewing notes after meetings is valuable, even when recordings exist.
- General administrative items were acknowledged before diving into technical topics.
- No additional major decisions raised.
