### PicoIce1 troubleshooting
I worked with Brooklyn to determine why I had no space left on my pico1 after I upload the micropython firmware. We walked through my entire boot and flashing process and couldn;t find anything I'm doing wrong. I sent this message to the devs in the discord:
>Hi, I have been trying to upload the micropython firmware to my pico-ice1, made from following the instructions here: [https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-micropython](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-micropython "https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-micropython"). I use this process for uploading the firmware: [https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html](https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html "https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html"). However, when I reboot and try to upload a Python file that programs the FPGA from a .bin file, I only have 16.4 kB available on the device, so I can't put any bitstreams on the device. Any ideas what could be causing this issue?

While waiting on a response, I did determine that my pico2 works fine, so I am at least able to make progress there.

I chatted a bit with the devs, and they told me to recreate the filesystem using the following commands:
```python
import vfs
import rp2
os.statvfs('/')
```
Which got everything working.
## Next
- Figure out how to use UART and memory on the FPGA. These examples should be useful:
	- For connecting the UART of the rp2 to the FPGA: https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/tree/main/examples/rp2_usb_uart
	- For programming the FPGA with C: https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/main/examples/rp2_ice_blinky/main.c
