### PicoIce1 troubleshooting
I worked with Brooklyn to determine why I had no space left on my pico1 after I upload the micropython firmware. We walked through my entire boot and flashing process and couldn;t find anything I'm doing wrong. I sent this message to the devs in the discord:
>Hi, I have been trying to upload the micropython firmware to my pico-ice1, made from following the instructions here: [https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-micropython](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-micropython "https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-micropython"). I use this process for uploading the firmware: [https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html](https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html "https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html"). However, when I reboot and try to upload a Python file that programs the FPGA from a .bin file, I only have 16.4 kB available on the device, so I can't put any bitstreams on the device. Any ideas what could be causing this issue?

While waiting on a response, I did determine that my pico2 works fine, so I am at least able to make progress there.

I chatted a bit with the devs, and they told me to recreate the filesystem using the following commands:
```python
import vfs
import rp2
os.statvfs('/')
```
Which got everything working.

### Pico Ice UART
Once I had verified I could program the pico ice + fpga with uf2 files correctly, I started trying to figure out how to use UART with the FPGA. 

I combined the following examples:
- For connecting the UART of the rp2 to the FPGA: https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/tree/main/examples/rp2_usb_uart
- For programming the FPGA with C: https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/main/examples/rp2_ice_blinky/main.c
- For having the FPGA transmit what it received: https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/tree/main/examples/ice_apio_uart_echo
So, my example takes whatever is sent to the pi with UART, forwards it to the FPGA, which echos the same thing back, and then the pi sends the data back to the user.

I used minicom as my UART inferface
```
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
```
Once in minicom, the user can use press `CTRL-A Z` to access help menus and settings.

The code for the example can be found [here](https://github.com/evolvablehardware/BitstreamEvolutionPico/tree/main/exampleProjectsC/rp2_ice_echo). Once the symbolic links to pico-ice-sdk and pico-sdk are updated, the project can be built with:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
The generated rp_ice_echo.uf2 file can then dragged-and-dropped into the RP2040 bootloader.
## Next
- Start to use the memory controller demos on the ice picos
	- I'll probably start with implicit BRAM since that is the simplest and is less device dependent
	- I'll need to figure out the tiles + BELs for the 5k device to get explicit BRAM working
	- I then can figure out how to use SPRAM
