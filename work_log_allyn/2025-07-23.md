### Pico Ice Programming
I was not able to figure out why I was not bale to apio to upload the fpga. One possible cause is since I'm using an usb-c to usb-c cable, that might mess with the product and manufacturer strings. However, Brooklyn said he's not using apio to program the 5k devices, so I decided to let that mystery be. 

I then worked on finding other ways of programming the board. Unfortunately, this isn't all easily documented in one place, so I had to do a fair bit of digging on how to program both the pi and the fpga.

#### Programming the RP2040 with C
This [repo](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/tree/main/examples) contains a bunch of examples of different firmware written in C. The examples all must have symlinks to pico-ice-sdk and pico-sdk. For each example, I would copy the directory into the top level of Brooklyn's repo. Then, from inside the example directory, I would run the following commands to update the symlinks to pico-ice-sdk and pico-sdk:
```bash
# remove existing symlinks
rm pico-ice-sdk
rm pico-sdk
# add new ones
ln -s ../lib/pico-ice-sdk/ pico-ice-sdk
ln -s ../lib/pico-ice-sdk/lib/pico-sdk/ pico-sdk
```
I believe most of them can be built using cmake:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
This would make an uf2 file, which could be dragged-and-dropped on the device, presuming the device was first rebooted with a jumper between the BT and Gnd pins. The jumper should be removed before the new firmware is put on the device.

#### Programming the RP2040 with MircroPython
To upload micropython code to the pi, we need to use a different firmware, found [here](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-micropython/releases). [Here](https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html) are the instructions for uploading a different firmware. Then python code can just be drag-and-dropped onto the device. However, I'm not able to upload any bin files, so I'm not sure how we use micropython to program the FPGA. 

If the python code uses the terminal to interact with the user, Brooklyn recommended using tio and running `tio /dev/ttyACM0`.

#### Programming the FPGA
.bin files for the FPGA can be generated the usual way. Tools such as [uf2-utils](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/uf2-utils) can be used to convert a .bin to an .uf2 file:
```bash
bin2uf2 -o rgb_blink.uf2 rgb_blink.bin
```
Then, presuming the [default firmware](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice/releases/) is loaded onto the device, the resulting uf2 file cna be dragged-and-dropped onto the device. [Here](https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__mcu.html) are the instructions for uploading a different firmware.
