## Log
Worked more on the UART Memory controller. I learned how to use iverilog with gtkwave to simulate the circuit and see waveforms, but didn't use it much throughout the day. Sometimes the simulation waveform did not line up with what would happen when I ran the circuit on actual HW. For some reason, issues seem to occur when I run the circuit at a clock speed besides 12 MHz, despite this being a parameter of the circuit.

My current goal is to allow users to pass in a size they would like to read and an address they would like to read from. I was able to get reading from an arbitrary address working, and then using the last couple of bits to determine the size to read, but am now running into issues when I try to transmit both bytes of data from the user. It seems to work mostly fine, except when I try reading from address 0 or 1. I'll need to create a test bench to figure out exactly what's going on.
## Next
- Debug the memory controller
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
