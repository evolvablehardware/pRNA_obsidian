### Bitstream Compression
During our meeting, Brooklyn and I were discussing various ways of speeding up the time it takes to get bitstream files onto the device. Brooklyn is currently looking into bulk data transfer modes for usb communication, but I'd suggested that compression algorithms could also help, as we could easily use the pi to decompress the bistreams.

Brooklyn found [this example](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberrypipico/comments/1lkr15n/super_fast_animation_rendering_on_the_pico_2/) of someone performing image decompression using the pi's DMA's, which is really similar to what they want to do. However, there isn't much of the source code posted. I found [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/862400) that does decompression on an FPGA's DMAs of bitstreams. If we continue to work in micropython, this is the [documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/rp2.DMA.html) for using the DMAs on the RP2040, which also contains an example.

From what I understand, DMA (direct memory access) is a memory controller that runs separately from the CPU. It can be useful when data is coming in faster than the CPU can process, or we want the CPU to do other things while data is being transferred. The DMA can transfer data between a read buffer and a write buffer and do simple operations.  Multiple DMAs also can be chained together to do more complex operations. 

I am having a hard time figuring out what a DMA can actually do and how we program them, so I might leave that as a future endeavor for someone who knows more about them. However, I feel comfortable implementing decompression using the pi's CPU. I will have to figure out which compression algorithm to use by figuring out what I can find implementations of and looking more closely at the bitstream structure. 

The decompression will increase the number of bitstreams we can store within the firmware. Once I have that working, I  can benchmark the time it takes to decompress a bitstream and how much space we save. Once Brooklyn has bulk data transfer working, we can measure how much time we save by transferring the compressed version. Ideally, we save more time transferring than we lose during decompression.
#### TLDR
- We can implement decompression algorithm on the pi to speed up bitstream transfers
- Using the DMAs (direct memory access) could provide further speed ups, but would be more complex
### BRAM Demo
I worked on getting my BRAM demo running on the 5k device. The first challenge I ran into was figuring out how to set up a reset signal so that the controller would be in a known state when I start transmitting information. For some reason, there's no uart RTS signal on the usb, which is what I was using on the 1k devices. I instead decided to use RP0 / ice27 after finding the pinout info for the board [source](https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_pinout.html)

```C
// reset state machine
gpio_init(0);
gpio_set_dir(0, GPIO_OUT);
gpio_put(0, 0);
sleep_ms(100);
gpio_put(0, 1
```

Even once I figured out the reset, the code did not work. I had the LEDs light up differently depending on what state the controller is in, and it seems to be perpetually stuck in the start state. Pyserial and minicom also both seem to freeze when I try sending data.
## Next
- Compression
	- Figure out which compression method works best for our bitstreams can be easily implemented/included within the pi's firmware code
	- Look more into DMA
- Debug uart connection on the pico
- Modify BRAM implementation for the 5k device
	- Add in the ability to specify how many blocks we want to initialize using a macro with yosys
	- Modify the script that generates all the explicit bram insts (bel locations are X6 + X19, Y1 Y3 ... Y29)
	- Modify the shell code + python memory controller wrapper to support different numbers of blocks
	- Add more targets to the makefile that build both the 1k and 5k devices
