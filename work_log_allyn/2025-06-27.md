### Continued work on the Memory Controller
I added in support for multiple EBRs. I originally only thought we could only use 8 EBRs, but it turned out the iCEstick can support 16. I modified the command structure to support this. The new structure will allow for SPI flash operations (once they're implemented), and up to 64 EBRs (while the max an iCE40 device supports is 32).

#### Changing clock frequency
Figured out how to use icepll to change the clock frequency (this [tutorial] was helpful). Unfortunately, changing the frequency is somewhat of a manual process. Not all frequencies are possible (i.e if we request 50 MHz we end up with 50.25 MHz), so we need to check and see what frequency we got. We also need to manually set a parameter in the top level verilog file with the frequency. With some grep and sed I could probably do this automatically in the ./commands file, but I don't see us changing the frequency too often, so I will hold off on doing that. 
#### Python Work
Restructured code to be organized and added user input validation to shell.py.

Also started working on a testbench tool. It generates all possible combinations of reads/writes, blocks, addresses, and sizes and runs the tests, recording the size and accuracy. The data is stored a to .csv file. The user can specify the seed to use for the shuffling of tasks and what fraction of the total possible tests to run. Example usage:
```bash
python3 src_python/run_testbench.py 1 0.0001
```

Example output:

## Next
### Goals for Monday
- Documentation (focusing on the verilog, but also the python if there is time)
- Finish up testbench tool
- Create data viz for the testbench tool
### Future Goals
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
