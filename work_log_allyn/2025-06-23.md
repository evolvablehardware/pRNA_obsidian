### BRAM + Warmbooting
Worked on trying to confirm that it is possible to avoid overwriting the BRAM while in warmbooting mode. I had some trouble here, and I'm not entirely sure why. The bitstream files would be around 23KB, which means they did not have BRAM info, but data was still being overwritten. My best guess was that there was a syntax error in the verilog that I did not catch while running the toolchain script, and so old .bin files were being uploaded to the FPGA.

Bash file
```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p temp  

./arduino-cli compile -b arduino:avr:nano arduino/arduino.ino
./arduino-cli upload -b arduino:avr:nano -p /dev/ttyUSB2 arduino/arduino.ino

for i in $(seq 1 2); do
icebram -g -s $i 16 256 > leds$i.hex
yosys -p "synth_ice40 -json temp/leds$i.json" leds$i.v
nextpnr-ice40 --hx1k --json temp/leds$i.json --pcf pins.pcf --asc temp/leds$i.asc --package tq144
icepack temp/leds$i.asc temp/leds$i.bin
done
  

for i in $(seq 3 4); do
icebram -g -s $i 16 256 > leds$i.hex
yosys -p "synth_ice40 -json temp/leds$i.json" leds$i.v
nextpnr-ice40 --hx1k --json temp/leds$i.json --pcf pins.pcf --asc temp/leds$i.asc --package tq144
icepack temp/leds$i.asc temp/leds$i.bin -n
done  

icemulti -p2 temp/leds1.bin temp/leds2.bin temp/leds3.bin temp/leds4.bin -o temp/leds_pack.bin
iceprog temp/leds_pack.bin
python3 terminal.py
```

Verilog
```verilog
module top (
	input wire clk,
	input wire boot_trigger,
	input wire [1:0] S,
	output reg [3:0] leds
);

reg [15:0] memory [0:255];
initial $readmemh("leds1.hex", memory);
reg boot = 0;

always @(posedge clk) begin
	if (boot_trigger) boot <= 1'b1;
end 

always @(posedge clk) begin
	leds <= memory[0][3:0];
end

SB_WARMBOOT warmboot (
	.S1(S[1]),
	.S0(S[0]),
	.BOOT(boot)
);

endmodule
```
### UART Memory Controller
I spent the rest of the day working on connecting a memory module with an UART interface.
I used verilog code from [this repo](https://github.com/ben-marshall/uart/tree/master) for the UART components, and [this repo](https://github.com/damdoy/ice40_ultraplus_examples/blob/master/bram/implicit_bram.v) for the memory modules. I was able to get something working where it would receive a 1 bytes address and transmit one of the bytes stored at that location in memory. However, when I tried adding a state machine to allow for longer reads/transmissions, I had trouble leaving the first state. I think the issue is that one of the control signals (uart_rx_valid) is only valid for a single pulse, but I was not able to resolve the issue. I will like have to write a test bench to more formally debug. I started looking into iverilog and GTKWave to figure out how to do that ([tutorial](https://emkboruett.medium.com/installing-icarus-verilog-and-gtkwave-on-ubuntu-for-verilog-simulation-d6d31eee2096)).

## Next
- Debug the memory controller to allow for longer transmissions
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
