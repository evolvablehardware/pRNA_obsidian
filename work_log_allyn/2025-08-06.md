## Log
I spent a lot of today trying to figure out how to measure the warmbooting time. i tried using my old Arduino code for triggering the warmboot and measuring the time, but it did not appear to be able to trigger the warmboot. I didn't try it too hard to make it work, as I'd figure it would just be better to write something on the pico anyways.

This was a slow process, as there's limited examples for C code. Most people seem to be using micropython. However, I did get a working [demo](https://github.com/evolvablehardware/BitstreamEvolutionPico/tree/main/exampleProjectsC/rp2_hello_world) that has examples of
- printing data to pc
- controlling input pins for the fpga
- interrupt handlers for the output of the fpga
- measuring elapsed time

That should be all the building blocks I need to measure warmbooting time, I just need to rewrite my Arduino code in C. It's also should be helpful in measuring reads/writes from the pico, but I'll also need to figure out some more UART intricacies.
