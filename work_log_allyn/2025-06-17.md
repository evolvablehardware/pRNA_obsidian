Fork of icestorm with iceprog modifications; https://github.com/rhit-loydma/icestorm_iceprog_partial
### Timing Analysis
Add timing checks to the 6 stages of reprogramming:
1. Init
2. Reset 1
3. Erase
4. Program
5. Verify
6. Reset 2
These can be displayed by adding -T to the `./iceprog` call.

Note that programming to SRAM only changes the reset 1, erase, and programming stages. SRAM takes shorter to reset, and we do not have to erase. Additionally, the verify stage can be skipped with the `-X` option. Disabling powerdown (`-k`) will shave some minor time off verification and the second reset. I'm not sure how necessary both resets are. If we know we're not going to be using the SPI flash for anything else, can we get away with just doing one of neither of the resets?

Using the default iceprog options:

| Stage   | Time (ms) |
| ------- | --------- |
| Init    | 1994      |
| Reset 1 | 255       |
| Erase   | 3114      |
| Program | 756       |
| Verify  | 126       |
| Reset 2 | 251       |
| Total   | 6496      |
When programming 2 chunks (as described yesterday, but without `-X` and `-k`):

| Stage   | Subsector 5 | Subsector 7 | Total |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Init    | 1986        | 1979        | 3965  |
| Reset 1 | 255         | 255         | 510   |
| Erase   | 371         | 366         | 737   |
| Program | 103         | 84          | 187   |
| Verify  | 16          | 15          | 31    |
| Reset 2 | 252         | 252         | 504   |
| Total   | 2983        | 2957        | 5940  |
Which saves only about half a second. However, I think i can modify iceprog to do individual subsectors in one call to the program. Then, the initialization and resets would only have to run once. New estimated time is $$1986 + 255 + (371+366) + (103+84) +(16+15) + 252 = 3448,$$ which cuts the original time nearly in half. 
### Modifying iceprog
Started modifying iceprog to do the subsector writing automatically, and without extra inits/reset

TODO
- [x] Helper function to determine what subsectors are different between two bitstreams
- [x]  Add in ability to pass in argument for the new mode
	- `-P <file>             write file contents to flash only where it differs from existing file on FPGA`
- [x] Add checking to ensure the new mode can be used with the rest of the provided parameters
- [x] Use the helper function to determine what subsectors are different
- [x] Erase only the subsectors that need to be erased
- [x] Write only the subsectors that need to be written
- [x] Remove magic numbers once basic implementation is working

Command to run:
```bash
./iceprog [bin to program] -i 4 -P [bin on the FPGA]
```

The new time taken is:

| Stage   | Time (ms) |
| ------- | --------- |
| Init    | 1965      |
| Reset 1 | 255       |
| Erase   | 705       |
| Program | 179       |
| Verify  | 127       |
| Reset 2 | 251       |
| Total   | 3483      |
The verify stage can be skipped. I could also modify it to only verify the subsectors we actually used. I tried playing around with removing one and both resets, and everything seems to work fine. The resets set the cs_b line to 1, and the first reset sets creset_b to 1, while the second reset sets creset_b line to 0. Both resets have `usleep(250000)` after the lines have been set. It might be possible that we do not have to wait the full 0.25 seconds for the reset to occur.

Nothing in this flowchart ([source](https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iCE40_Programming_Configuration_2022.pdf)) suggests we should have to wait that long:

Furthermore, it seems that if I run iceprog commands in quick enough succession (like less than 2-3 seconds) the init time is 450-460 ms. 

Another option could be to keep the mpsse line open and evaluating circuits with it still open. I'm not sure if this would impact neural network performance, but it does not seem to impact my simple circuits for controlling the LEDs. This could remve the need for running the init stage each time. We could instead tell the iceprog tool a series of .bins to program to the FPGA. 
### Other Avenues to Explore
If we're just modifying the parameters stored in BRAM throughout evolution, it might be quicker to just have a BRAM controller written in verilog. I'm not sure how much logic tiles that would take up, so we could warmboot with a memory controller and a neural network.

I'm also curious to see how the compact bitstreams from [[Fritzsch2022]] interface with the iceprog tool. If it's true that the BRAM data does not get change during configuration (see background section), we should be able to dramatically cut down on the size of the bitstream that is sent. They referenced 
>Lattice Semiconductor Technical Staff, *iCE40 Programming and Configuration, Lattice Semiconductor*, Mar. 2020.

for this, which i believe can be found [here](https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iCE40_Programming_Configuration_2022.pdf). However, that document does not mention anything specific to the BRAM, but says "at the beginning of the configuration, all the SRAM has been cleared to 0." I'm not sure if this is referring to SRAM generally, or just the configuration SRAM. 

I did try playing around with the tool from [[Fritzsch2022]], but their documentation says its only for 8k devices, and I got this error when I tried using it on a 1k bitstream: `ValueError: Wrong CRAM width: expected 872,but was 332`. Though it seems like there's partial support for 1k devices. I saw the device spec in the code, and there is an option for it, but I get an error when I try it:

## Next
- Figure out if its possible for the FPGA to be operational while writing to the SPI flash.
- Play around more with the bitstream compaction tool.
- Explore the idea of an on-chip memory-controller
