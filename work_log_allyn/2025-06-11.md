### Memory Usage in Warm Boot Configuration
Worked on trying to understand where the warmboot images are stored in memory. [This technical note, pg. 14](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/iCE40ProgrammingandConfiguration.pdf) on programming and configuration suggests they are being stored in read-only memory. ![[Pasted image 20250610130742.png]]
However, the warmboot application is able to modify the SPI Flash to control which bitstream is swapped to. I'm not entirely sure where bitstreams are stored when they are not being the one swapped to. Apparently "read-only" is a bit of a misnomer in this case, as the flash can be reprogrammed using things such as JTAG programmer or USB blaster.

[[Fritzsch2022]] (background section) suggests the the configuration data is stored in RAM:
>Like most modern FPGAs, iCE40 devices are based on SRAM cells. The SRAM, in turn, is split between configuration memory (CRAM) and block RAM. BRAM represents only the contents of the embedded memory, while CRAM represents every other aspect of the configuration. CRAM and BRAM are each split in four banks. Each of which correspond to a quadrant of the iCE40 physical chip.

They then say:
>During the configuration process, the chip clears the whole CRAM while the BRAM is left unchanged [15]. Afterwards the bitstream is loaded into the FPGA.

Which contradicts [the technical note, pg. 2](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/iCE40ProgrammingandConfiguration.pdf)
> At the beginning of the configuration, all the SRAM has been cleared to â€œ0"

[[umarcor2021]] For loading a single bitstream:
>That is, in the iCEstick and similar boards, the FTDI resets the FPGA by asserting `CRESET_B` and lets it power up in slave SPI mode by keeping `SPI_SS_B` low. Then, the image is written to the SRAM directly.

However, with a different command (not shown):
>This time, the FTDI explicitly holds the FPGA in reset state and asserts the chip select signal of the flash memory. Then, the image is written to the flash memory. When the transference is complete, the reset state is released and the FPGA is powered up in master SPI mode. Therefore, the image written just before is loaded from the flash memory. For more information check [TN1248, pp 10-13].

[[Fritzsch2022]] does not mention SPI at all. I'm guessing that they just abstracted it out as is not relevant to compactifying the bitstream. 
#### TLDR
In the warmboot mode, all 4 bitstreams are stored in the SPI Flash PROM. While this memory isn't true read-only, it's not clear if the FPGA can easily write to it, which is what we would like for it to be able to do. When the FPGA is programmed, the RAM is reset on the FPGA and the bitstream is loaded into the configuration RAM. 
### SPI Interface
I started exploring how we could write to the SPI from the FPGA. This [set of examples](https://github.com/damdoy/ice40_ultraplus_examples) has an example of reading from SPI flash (flash dir), but it's not as clear if it has an example of writing to the SPI flash. I think spi or spi_hw might have what I want. 

These examples are also for the Breakout board, so I'm worried they might not work on the 1k board, especially since we dealing with the peripheries of the board. 

Though, since the examples focus on the PC writing to flash for the FPGA to read, I'm wondering if we couldn't just have the PC directly write the patches onto the circuit. This means we can avoid having to write a bootloader that would also need to process patch information. However, in the flash example, all the data is written to the flash when iceprog is called. 

This comment in the readme makes me think that the PC will not be able to directly apply the patches:
>`make prog_flash` will write the FPGA configuration to the separate flash chip on the breakout board. However the FPGA will not be able to communicate with the host through the USB using the SPI in this mode. A power cycle may be also be needed for the FPGA to read the configuration from the flash memory.

But there is is this comment in the [technical note](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/iCE40ProgrammingandConfiguration.pdf):
>After configuration, the SPI port pins are available to the user-application as additional PIO pins, supplied by the VCC_SPI input voltage.

I also looked some at [iceprog's source code](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm/blob/master/iceprog/iceprog.c) to see if some of it could be reused to apply patches to the bitstream. Nothing I saw suggested it couldn't. However, I'm still am not sure if the FPGA has to be rest before the flash can be written to. That is what the datasheets suggest, but I'm not seeing what the benefits are to forcing a reset. Maybe preventing unexpected code/circuit execution on the FPGA as a security measure? I know the SPI flash can be written to during normal execution and can be used to have the FPGA and PC communicate, so I don't think it has to be. When I was looking for resources on writing to the SPI flash using ChatGPT, it said it was not recommended as it could overwrite the bitstream area, which is what we want.
#### Questions going forward
- Can the PC write to the SPI flash in warmboot mode?
- Can I resuse methods from iceprog to do so, or will I need something more custom?
- If the PC cannot do it, will the FPGA logic be able to do so?
- How can I test that the patches are accurately applied to the FPGA without risking damage to the FPGA?
### Misc
I started looked at some of the [dynamic neural network resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DecYUHM6FmM-AnhUXJ-uE8_212LTYa2NnGHwxztAwos/edit?tab=t.0), mostly just skimming some of the first couple of resources. 

Made sure my system could run the IceStorm tools and process binary files.
