### Implementation/Testing Plan
1. Confirm the FPGA can use the the SPI as general purpose memory and IO after it has been programmed using the SPI memory ([using this demo](https://github.com/damdoy/ice40_ultraplus_examples/tree/master/flash) to read values in from the flash that were written during configuration.)
2. Use the PC to write to the flash during operation by using methods from [iceprog](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm/blob/master/iceprog/iceprog.c). If we can write, we should be able to read, so this should not be difficult to verify. 
3. Figure out how to use warm booting load two circuits that can switch to each other. Ideally, the swapping should be controlled by some signal from the PC or MCU, but I also have some push buttons to use while we're still early in development. The two circuits could light up the FPGA's LEDs in different ways so that we can confirm they're actually swapping back and forth. 
4. Use the PC to overwrite part of the second circuit's bitstream. Verify the changes went through correctly before swapping to the circuit. The changes could be something like modifying which LEDs get lit up.
5. Confirm we can swap back to circuit 1 from circuit 2, even after circuit 2 has been modified.
6. Figure out how to warm boot more than 4 images using the information in [[umarcor2021]].
7. Integrate bitstream patching with the expanded warm booting.
8. Benchmark whether its faster to warm boot just two circuits - a controller and an evolved bitstream (less large memory moves, but more patches), or many circuits (many large memory swaps done on-chip, but fewer patches).
### Bin Difference Tool
Wrote a python tool to analyze two bitstream files and find what bytes are different. I currently output the results to a .csv file:

It might make more sense to rewrite this code in C/C++ in order to easily use iceprog's code for writing to the SPI flash.

One thing I test it one was two previously evolved circuits (HW 1 and 10 from this [experiment](https://github.com/evolvablehardware/BitstreamEvolutionPopulations/tree/main/AL2/2_9_24_pulse_40k)):
```
Found 89 patches with 95 bytes, out of a total of 32220 bytes.
```
Most patches are only one byte long and are found throughout the entire bitstream, which is what we would expect based on the way we mutate the bitstream. 
### General SPI Notes
Googled anything talking about iCE40's flash to see if I could find more information/advice on interfacing with it. Some things found:
- [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/rf8wmr/lattice_ice40lp1k_84qfn_spi_flash_programming/) on avoiding triggering the reset on the FPGA. Their solution was just do a power cycle to update the image
- [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/17v1nkz/comment/k9asd1o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) confirming that the SPI will need to be told to "wake up" after it has programmed the FPGA. The iceprog source code has a method for doing so.
- [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/12du5nw/trouble_flashing_the_code_onto_ice40hx8k/) with some of the difficulties of programming the iCE40s with SPI. At least for the 8k, it's not possible to use the SPI as both a programmer and GPIO without physically changing a jumper connection, but we hopefully won't run into this on the 1k boards as there are no jumper connections.
- A couple of pages ([a](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/122550/flash-memory-does-the-entire-page-need-to-be-erased-before-writing-just-a-few-b),[b](https://community.infineon.com/t5/XMC/Can-I-write-program-one-byte-to-the-flash-or-maybe-only-one-word-32-bits/td-p/311828) ,[c](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32cubemx-mcus/not-able-to-write-one-byte-in-internal-flash-memory/td-p/671979)) mentioning how there a minimum write sizes for some flash memories, as flashes can only erase a whole page at once. The iCEstick uses the Micron 32Mbit N25Q32 SPI flash, which appears to have a 4KB sector erase. So, we can't exactly do small patches. However, this is only about 1/8th of the bitstream for our previously evolved circuits. So if we could find a way to make sure most of our parameters end up in the same page of the flash, we can cut down on reconfiguration time.
## Next
- Continue to develop the bin differences tool
	- Possibly rewrite in C++
	- Knowing that a flash cannot erase anything smaller than a page, it makes sense to add a minimum patch size, or at least a way of figuring out how many pages will need to be overwritten.
- Continue to learn more about how/when the SPI interface can be used
- Continue to look at CTRNN resources
