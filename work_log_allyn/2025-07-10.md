## Log
I was able to successfully integrate my script from yesterday to find which blocks of BRAM are on the same tiles within my shell program. It looks like this:

It doesn't really make sense when the non-memory controller circuit only uses one EBR, but I don't have a circuit prepared that uses more than one. But if a circuit uses multiple, the user will be able to look at the instantiation names and find the right block number. 

I also created a config for shell.py, so that users can specify what USB port their FPGA is plugged into and the BRAM placements for the circuit they are warmbooting with:
```ini
[DEFAULT]
fpga_port = /dev/ttyUSB1
circuit_bram_placements = temp/demo_bram_placement.txt
```
I was originally going to do those as command line arguments, but I figured a config file might make more sense as these parameters won't change between most runs.

Once I had that done, I thought the demo would be good to go for the demo, but the memory output for the circuit was not matching what I expected to be. It was outputting data not in the memory for the controller nor in the data file used by the circuit (which should be discarded anyways by the `icepack -n` option).

When I tried loading the demo by itself (without `icepack -n`), I get an output that I expect (i.e. data from demo/data.hex). Furthermore, when I warmboot the memory controller and the circuit (without `icepack -n` on the circuit), I see data from demo/data.hex, which makes sense. Because of this, I feel confident that my design for the circuit is correct. 

When I try programming just the circuit and skip initializing BRAM, I see the same wrong values. I used `icepack -u -vv` (unpack bin verbosely: outputs commands in the binary file as it finds them in the bin file) to make sure there were no commands to write BRAM. I also used the bulk erase option for the SPI flash to make sure that wasn't causing any issues. 

I asked ChatGPT ([conversation link](https://chatgpt.com/share/68702263-85a8-8001-8bbc-8dc787ccc406)) for advice, and it said that BRAM might still be overwritten if our two designs have different memory layouts, as routing changes might override parts of BRAM. It suggested that we will need to use the same BRAM inst and make sure the BRAM blocks are placed on the same BELs. It gave a script for nextpnr's --pre-pack option to do this. It also said some parts of the netlist must be the same:

ChatGPT suggested using explicit instantiations of BRAM for more control. I am really hoping that this is not necessary. 

I made the top level of the controller and demo as similar as possible and started trying to figure out how to set the BELs of tiles while running a script using nextpnr's --pre-pack option. I think I made some progress, because I am able to control the placements for the controller. I think the issue might be that only 8 EBRs are getting placed for the demo circuit.

## Next
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
	- Figure out placement constraints or figure out alternative approach
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
