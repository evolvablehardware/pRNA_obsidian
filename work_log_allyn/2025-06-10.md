### Misc. Research
Looked into the basics of SPI controllers to see if that is something that could be optimized, but didn't go to far down that route.

Stumbled across [TinyFPGA](https://tinyfpga.com/), a series of open source FPGAs. It looks like the TinyFPGA BX uses the ICE40LP8K chip, so it would probably work for our project. It's bit unclear whether they are still being maintained and/or produced, but I found this [listing](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-ax-bx#products) for only $49. Though from this [link](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-ax-bx), it seems that the BX might not be fully integrated with the IceStorm toolkit, but I think this documentation might be older. 

Looked more at the [[umarcor2021]] resource. I'm currently trying to figure out what would need to be done to be able to pack an entire population of circuits and have some controller (probably the MCU using a signal wire) switch between the images one by one.

### iCE40 Configuration Process
#### Reset
Looked at how the configuration process for iCE40 works at a low level. It seems that once a reset signal has been sent, the board resets itself and then starts reading the SPI lines ([image source](https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iCE40_Programming_Configuration_2022.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A88%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C51%2C720%2C0%5D)). I'm under the impression that sending data to the SPI pins will have no impact, but maybe its possible we just need the SPI_SS to go low.

After further research, it seems like we need to trigger the reset for the FPGA to sample SPI_SS.
> After exiting the Power-On Reset (POR) state or when CRESET_B returns High after being held Low, the iCE40device samples the logical value on its SPI_SS_B pin. Like other programmable I/O pins, the SPI_SS_B pin has an internal pull-up resistor. Refer to the iCE40LP/HX Family Data Sheet for the minimum pulse width requirement of CRESET_B. ([Source](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/iCE40ProgrammingandConfiguration.pdf))

It seems like there might be some separation ([image source](https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iCE40_Programming_Configuration_2022.pdf)) between sending the reset signal (CRESET_B), the spi bank, and the board logic, but it not clear how those components communicate with each other.

The image below shows the components at a higher level ([Source](https://pages.hmc.edu/brake/class/e155/fa23/assets/doc/FPGA-DS-02008-2-0-iCE40-UltraPlus-Family-Data-Sheet.pdf))

I did find some more detail ([images source](https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iCE40_Programming_Configuration_2022.pdf)) about what triggers the reset, but not how this interfaces with the SPI protocol.

#### Configuration
The FPGA at least expects all configuration bits to be sent in one stream once the SPI process has been initialized. I'm not sure whether or not this is required. 
> After transferring the required number configuration data bits, the iCE40 device ends the Fast Read command by de-asserting its SPI_SS_B PROM select output, as shown in Figure 9. ([source](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/iCE40ProgrammingandConfiguration.pdf))

>Send configuration image serially on SPI_SI to iCE40, most-significant bit first, on falling edge of SPI_SCK. Send the entire image, without interruption. Ensure that SPI_SCK frequency is between 1 mHz and 25 MHz. ([source](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/iCE40ProgrammingandConfiguration.pdf))

Once the data is sent, I'm not entirely sure what is done with it. It seems like the cold/warm boot controls are just black boxes ([source](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/iCE40ProgrammingandConfiguration.pdf)]. However, we might not need to know the exact specifics of these since we'll have to overwrite them with modules that can handle receiving partial bitstreams. The warm boot control is an user-specified circuit, so we could relatively easily design something that would take in the partial bitstreams and put them in the right place in the SPI PROM. However, then we would have to switch back and forth between the warm boot controller and the modified bitstream. ![[Pasted image 20250610130742.png]]
#### TLDR
The reset signal needs to be triggered for the iCE40 to start reading in configuration data from the SPI bus. However, it is not clear how the reset triggers this process (i.e. how IO bank with the reset signal connects to the SPI bank). If we could figure out how to solve that problem, I'm not sure how we could modify the bootloaders to efficiently handle the partial bitstreams.

### Utilizing Warm Booting
[[umarcor2021]] theorizes it is possible to store more than 100 bitstreams at once. This has been done with 8 bitstreams as a proof of concept ([link](https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice/tree/draft/projects/ice40-dynboot)). The PoC utilizes a custom a warm bootloader that uses C code running on a RISC-V processor to swap images from the inaddressable to addressable memory space, and handles swapping to the next image. Each of the other binaries have a mechanism for switching back to the bootloader, which I believe would not take up little room. They didn't include all the toolchain commands they used to set up this project, and I'm not sure if we can run a RISC-V processor on the 1k board. However, I think it's possible to write a verilog equivalent of the C code. 

A video demonstration ([source code and tutorial](https://x.com/sylefeb/status/1388586566591913985)) of switching back and forth between two images (without a custom bootloader image) can be found [here](https://x.com/sylefeb/status/1388586566591913985). It appears to take less than a second to switch between the two images on the iCEBreaker board. 

I think it would make sense to send the bitstreams for a whole population packed together. This makes it easier to write the bootloader, as we just have to run each circuit once, in order. This would greatly cut down on the time externally communicating with the PC. However, I think the bootloader could also be expanded to accept partial bitstream information and make the needed memory modifications between generations. This way, we only have to send full bitstreams to the FPGA during the initialization of the FPGA algorithm. All of the mutations can be handled through serial communication with the bootloader. 

Below is the C code of the bootloader switching between 8 images. It should not be difficult to expand it with a serial interface for overwriting specific parts of the patch.
```C
void main()
{
  spiflash_init();

  // read address from current header
  spiflash_read_begin(73);
  next_bitstream_addr = 0;
  *((unsigned char*)(&next_bitstream_addr) + 2) = spiflash_read_next();
  *((unsigned char*)(&next_bitstream_addr) + 1) = spiflash_read_next();
  *((unsigned char*)(&next_bitstream_addr) + 0) = spiflash_read_next();
  spiflash_read_end();

  // update it
  if (next_bitstream_addr < (104250 + 7*104090)) {
    next_bitstream_addr = next_bitstream_addr + 104090;
  } else {
  	next_bitstream_addr = 104250;
  }
	
  // copy back
  spiflash_copy_patch_4KB(0x100000,0x000000,patch_vector); 
  
  // reboot to slot 1  
  while (1) {
  	*WARMBOOT = (1<<9) | 1;
  }
}
```

Based on the results on the [[Fritzsch2022]] paper, where they explored ways of compactifying the bitstream, most of the reconfiguration time is spent writing the CRAM data into the SRAM, instead of the actual process of loading the circuit onto the FPGA. ![[Pasted image 20250609135039.png]]
