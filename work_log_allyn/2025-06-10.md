## Log
Looked into the basics of SPI controllers to see if that is something that could be optimized, but didn't go to far down that route.

Stumbled across [TinyFPGA](https://tinyfpga.com/), a series of open source FPGAs. It looks like the TinyFPGA BX uses the ICE40LP8K chip, so it would probably work for our project. It's bit unclear whether they are still being maintained and/or produced, but I found this [listing](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-ax-bx#products) for only $49. Though from this [link](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-ax-bx), it seems that the BX might not be fully integrated with the IceStorm toolkit, but I think this documentation might be older. 

Looked more at the [[umarcor2021]] resource. I'm currently trying to figure out what would need to be done to be able to pack an entire population of circuits and have some controller (probably the MCU using a signal wire) switch between the images one by one.

Looked at how the configuration process for iCE40 works at a low level. It seems that once a reset signal has been sent, the board resets itself and then starts reading the SPI lines. 

It seems like there not me some separation ([image source](https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iCE40_Programming_Configuration_2022.pdf)) between sending the reset signal (CRESET_B), the spi bank, and the board logic, but it not clear how those components communicate with each other.

I did find some more detail ([images source](https://blog.aleksander.kaweczynski.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iCE40_Programming_Configuration_2022.pdf)) about what triggers the reset, but not how this interfaces with the SPI protocol.
