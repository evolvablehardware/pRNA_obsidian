## Log
Looked into the basics of SPI controllers to see if that is something that could be optimized, but didn't go to far down that route.

Stumbled across [TinyFPGA](https://tinyfpga.com/), a series of open source FPGAs. It looks like the TinyFPGA BX uses the ICE40LP8K chip, so it would probably work for our project. It's bit unclear whether they are still being maintained and/or produced, but I found this [listing](https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-ax-bx#products) for only $49. 

Looked more at the [[umarcor2021]] resource. I'm currently trying to figure out what would need to be done to be able to pack an entire population of circuits and have some controller (probably the MCU using a signal wire) switch between the images one by one.
