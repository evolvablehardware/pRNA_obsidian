## Log
Wrote python code to interface with the SPRAM and started testing the SPRAM implementation. I had to debug a couple of small things thing in both the python and verilog code to get it working.

Since we can't init the SPRAM with an hex file, I added an option to the python shell to init the SPRAM with a data file by repeatedly sending write commands. This takes about 26 seconds to run, which is annoying, but I can't think of a better way to get the SPRAM to a known state. We could have something in the verilog set all the data to 0 faster, but we would still need to write in all our NN params. 

SPRAM take it preserved across reboots and warmbooting, which is useful, but does mean there's not a way to 'reset' the SPRAM, without waiting 26 seconds for the PC to do it.
### Explicit BRAM issues
When trying to use explicit BRAM, all the data is initialized as 0. If we write data, we can then read it fine. I'm not sure why this is occurring, but I'm not too worried about it, since implicit BRAM works fine.
### PICO2 issues
On the Pico 2, every command seems to be interpreted as a BRAM command. I haven't had time to debug this, but I'm at a lost for why this would be occuring.
### Testbench Results
We can read/write a maximum of 24 locations of SPRAM without overflowing the RP buffer, so I only compared BRAM vs SPRAM on those sizes.

Ran 5000 tests with a random seed of 0 on the pico1 using implicit BRAM. SPRAM operations are slightly faster than BRAM operations.

Time vs size, block, addr, and overtime are all consistent with the results from BRAM
