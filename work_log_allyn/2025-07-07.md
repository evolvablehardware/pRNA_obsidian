### Profiling Read Time
Started working on figuring out why this step function occurs when we read data of various sizes using our memory controller. My bet is that it is due to something in the software.

I looked some at pyserial's source code and noticed that for their read operation, they create an empty bytearray and then append to it one byte at a time. I thought the step function might be due to the array dynamically resizing, so I timed how long it takes to create byte arrays of various sizes. However, the time needed grows linearly in this case.
```python
b = bytearray()
for i in range(size):
	b.append(random.randint(0,255))
return b
```

I also confirmed that the timeout for the serial object did not impact the results.

I then started looking at profilers, using this [blog post](https://realpython.com/python-profiling/) as a reference. `cProfile` is probably our best bet, as it is determinstic, detailed, and has less overhead than `profile`. Linux systems can also use `perf`, which has the most detail as it is apart of the kernel. I will probably start with `cProfile` and see if that gives us enough detail before moving onto system-dependent tools. cProfile can be used like so:
```python
cProfile.run('mc.read(0, 0, 1)', "../profiles/test.profile")
```

For viewing the results of the profiler, I found a library, [gprof2dot](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot), that allows the callstack to be visualized as a graph. Installation:
```bash
sudo apt install graphviz
pip install gprof2dot
```
Usage:
```bash
prof2dot -f pstats profiles/test.profile -o profiles/calling_graph.dot
dot -Tsvg profiles/calling_graph.dot > profiles/calling_graph.svg
```

You can also compare two profiles:
```bash
gprof2dot -f pstats --compare profiles/small_read.profile profiles/large_read.profile -o profiles/comparison.dot --compare-color-by-difference --node-label=self-time

dot -Tsvg profiles/comparison.dot > profiles/comparison.svg
```

The only major difference between the two profiles is that select.select is called one for the small read, and three times for the large read. Each select call takes about 10k microseconds to run, which accounts for most of the jump in the step function. Here is the code that calls select.select (minus error handling):
```python
read = bytearray()
while len(read) < size:
	try:
		ready, _, _ = select.select([self.fd, self.pipe_abort_read_r], [], [], timeout.time_left())
		buf = os.read(self.fd, size - len(read))
		# ...
		# error/execption handling
		# ...
	else:
		# ...
		# error/execption handling
		# ...
		read.extend(buf)
```
So, it seems that not all the data is available when we first go to read, so we have to go through multiple iterations to get all the data. If we add a small sleep between when we request the data and go to read the data, then reading takes barely any more time than the sleep:

#### TLDR
- The step function corresponds with iterations of a awhile loop as we wait fro the FPGA to transmit all the data
- I used cProfile, gprof2dot, and graphviz to colelct, view, and compare profiles

### Warmbooting  with the memory controller
Started working warmbooting the memory controller with a different circuit to have a demo of the circuit. I designed a circuit that starting at address 0, uses the lowest 6 bits of the memory location to output an ASCII character between 64 and 127, and then uses the highest byte of the memory location to determine what address to go to next. It repeats this process 32 times. This circuit was pretty easy to design, since a lot of it is just a pruned version of the integrated memory controller. It also gives us an easy way of making sure that memory changes when we warmboot with the memory controller.

 I realized we had an extra bit in the first byte we are sending at the start of every command, so I modified our command structure like so:

| ==**Byte 1**== |                                 |                                                      |                               |                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Bit**        | 7                               | 6                                                    | 5                             | 4:0                                  |
| **Data**       | 1 if SPI operation, 0 otherwise | 0 if reading/loading, 1 if writing/flash programming | 1 if warmbooting, 0 otherwise | EBR/SPI subsector to read/write from |
Tomorrow I will work on warmbooting the two images together and making sure I have the warmbooting logic correct. I will then use a hillclimber algorithm to have a working demo of memory being changed throughout 'evolution.'
## Next
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
