### Explicit BRAM
I spent some time trying to figure out why the implicit and explicit BRAM implementations have such different LUT usage. I confirmed that all the modules are the same besides the bram one. I found that yosys has a command for printing out device utilization, so I was able to confirm that the only difference between the designs is the number of wires used and the the number of SB_LUT4. I tried to clean up the explicit design as much as I could, but was only able to make minor improvements. 

Implicit:
```yosys
   Number of wires:                267
   Number of wire bits:            854
   Number of public wires:         267
   Number of public wire bits:     854
   Number of memories:               0
   Number of memory bits:            0
   Number of processes:              0
   Number of cells:                345
     SB_CARRY                       39
     SB_DFF                         20
     SB_DFFE                         1
     SB_DFFESR                      96
     SB_DFFESS                       1
     SB_DFFSR                        2
     SB_DFFSS                        2
     SB_LUT4                       167
     SB_RAM40_4K                    16
     SB_WARMBOOT                     1
```

Explicit:
```yosys
   Number of wires:                340
   Number of wire bits:           1075
   Number of public wires:         340
   Number of public wire bits:    1075
   Number of memories:               0
   Number of memory bits:            0
   Number of processes:              0
   Number of cells:                553
     SB_CARRY                       39
     SB_DFF                         20
     SB_DFFESR                      96
     SB_DFFESS                       1
     SB_DFFSR                        2
     SB_DFFSS                        2
     SB_LUT4                       376
     SB_RAM40_4K                    16
     SB_WARMBOOT                     1
```

I looked for more yosys tools for comparing the designs in more detail, but wasn't really finding things. They have ways of visualizing the design, but since it is such a big design, it would be really hard to actually spot any differences.

I did try printing out all the cells in both design using a post-route script in nextpnr. Most of the cell names are different, so it is had to compare the outputs, but most of the added cells seem to be in the uart_tx module, which makes no sense as this module is the same and instantiated the same in both designs. [Here](https://www.diffchecker.com/rdIniTxy/) is the difference between the two list cells. I have no clue what could be causing this, or how to fix this. 

### Pico Ice
I spent the remaining time I had looking at the specs and examples for the ice pico to get a better sense of how the tools work.
## Next
- Clean up my git repo (didn't have time to properly merge a branch so some of my code is currently out of date, especially related to the hex data files)
- Start to implement SPRAM things
- Figure out BRAM bel names on the 5k device so that I can use them with my src_python/generate_bram_inst.py script
