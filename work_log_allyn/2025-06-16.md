## Log
Worked on getting Obsidian + slack + git set up/updated on my Ubuntu dual-boot so I have an easier way of using the FPGAs while working. 

### IceProg details
Went through a lot of the iceprog source code to learn more about how it works. I was originally thinking I would have to write a custom program that uses some of their helper functions to do what I want, but I thin we can use some of their built-in options:
- -o \<offset in bytes\>: start writing at a specific address
- -k: skip powerdown of flash
- -i \[4,32,64\]: erase blocksize
- -X: skip verifying flash contents after writing
- -c: only verify flash contents. might be useful if we want to do one verification pass after writing multiple individual sectors
- -e \<size in byes\>: erase flash as if we were writing that number of bytes

I also looked into writing to specific address in the SRAM. It seems like the interface does not support providing addresses, and we can only write starting from the first address. 

Furthermore, on [[2025-06-12|Thursday]], I had discovered that there was always 2 bytes different at the end of the bitstream file and assumed it was some sort of hash or error correction. I was hoping we would not need to overwrite these bytes each time we modify a bitstream, and I tried modifying a bitstream and programming it without modifying the two bits. However, I don't think it worked. The modification I made changed which LEDs were on, but the new bitstream did not run on any LEDs.

In the iceprog documentation, I found more information about programming to SRAM on the iCEsticks:

Unfortunately the link to the picture appears to be defunct.

I was hoping to find a way to write to the SPI flash while the FPGA was still operational, so that we could do the transmission of one circuit while the current one is being evaluated, but I have not figured out how to do that yet. It seems like the FPGA goes into a different mode as soon as we start erasing the flash. I'm not sure why it does this, as we have not touched the CRAM yet at this stage. I know the SPI flash can be used for general purpose memory operations, so I'm not sure why the FPGA goes into a different mode. This might be something I need to mess around with in the iceprog source code.

Figured out command for copying one subsector on a bitstream to a temp file
```bash
tail -c +[4096*subsector_num+1] full.bin | head -c 4096 > subsector.bin
```
Then, a single subsector can be programmed like so:
```bash
iceprog subsector.bin -o [4096*subsector_num] -i 4 -k -X
```
The time to completely program a bitstream is about 6 seconds. When 2 chunks need to be modified and are done so using the above commands, the time is about 4.3 seconds. I'm hoping to optimize the iceprog code to do the chunk modifications without resetting in between. 

However, before I do that, I should first combine/automate some of my tools. Currently, all of the following are separate:
1. Finding which chunks of a bitstream are different
2. Writing those chunks to separate bin files
3. Partially programming the FPGA with the above files

I started figuring out how to modify the iceprog sourcecode to do all of the above.
## Next
- Automate the subsector overwriting process.
- Figure out if its possible for the FPGA to be operational while writing to the SPI flash.
