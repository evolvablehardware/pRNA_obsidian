### Data Transfer Speeds
FTDI chip has a max of 6Mbps. I'm not entirely sure what the max baudrate we can achieve with the iCE40's are. It seems like the theoretical max clock speed is 275 MHz, and if we sample each bit 16 times, then we would have a baud rate of 17 MHz, so it should be possible to achieve 6MHz. 

Furthermore, if we are just sending our BRAM patches, then we would be dramatically cutting down the amount of bits we have to send. The RAM configuration bits make up about 8\% of the total bitstream. We might not need to transfer data as fast to still save time. 

### BRAM
Looked into more details about the BRAM on the iCE40's. The iCEstick contains 8 EBRs, which are 4KB of RAM that can be configured in the following ways: [(source, p. 5)](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/MemoryUsageGuideforiCE40Devices.pdf)

It seems that we might not have to rewrite all of the EBRs when we configure the chip. [(source, p. 6)](https://www.workver.com/wv/FPGA/MemoryUsageGuideforiCE40Devices.pdf)

However, it is unclear whether the BRAM data is overwritten when warmbooting. So, I would need to test this. From [[umarcor2021]],
>It would be interesting to know whether BRAM data is necessarily overwritten when a new bitstream is loaded. If that is the case, it might be possible to use the pipeline approach from Sylvain for hot-replacing the content of the BRAMs when an image is changed. That would allow the implementation of complex algorithms on the same data. The advantage would be that freshly loaded images could start computation straightaway after load. However, depending on the use case, it might more efficient to have some custom save/load mechanism.

If that works, then we can warmboot:
- A memory controller. I plan building off implementations of a [bram controller](https://github.com/damdoy/ice40_ultraplus_examples/tree/master/bram) and [uart](https://github.com/bnossum/uart_ice40)
- And a neural network that reads its parameters in from BRAM. We can warmboot up to 3 of these easily, if we want to explore several different architectures at once. 

### Warmboot Demo
Worked on getting a working demo for the warmboot feature. It was a bit tricky to figure out how to trigger the rebooting properly, but I eventually got it figured out. The time it takes to switch between images seems barely perceptible. 
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9yyi8yIC7o)
Each image displays numbers of LEDs. The Arduino controls the warmboot triggers process, based on the number sent through the serial interface with the PC. The Arduino is connected to the FPGA with three wires. The first triggers the warmboot, while the other two tell the FPGA which image to switch to. We could handle the switching process from within the FPGA if each image knew what image to switch to, and when to switch (i.e. waiting for a certain amount of time before switching).

Verilog code (seq needs to be be changed for each .v file):
```verilog
module top (
	input wire clk,
	input wire boot_trigger,
	input wire [1:0] S,
	output wire [3:0] leds
);

reg [3:0] seq = 4'b0001;
reg boot = 0;  

always @(posedge clk) begin
	if (boot_trigger) boot <= 1'b1;
end

assign leds = seq;

SB_WARMBOOT warmboot (.S1(S[1]), .S0(S[0]), .BOOT(boot));

endmodule
```

PCF file:
```
set_io --warn-no-port leds[0] 99
set_io --warn-no-port leds[1] 98
set_io --warn-no-port leds[2] 97
set_io --warn-no-port leds[3] 96
set_io --warn-no-port clk 21
set_io --warn-no-port boot_trigger 119
set_io --warn-no-port S[0] 118
set_io --warn-no-port S[1] 117
```

Commands:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p temp

for i in $(seq 1 4);
do
yosys -p "synth_ice40 -json temp/leds$i.json" leds$i.v
nextpnr-ice40 --hx1k --json temp/leds$i.json --pcf pins.pcf --asc temp/leds$i.asc --package tq144
icepack temp/leds$i.asc temp/leds$i.bin
done
  
icemulti -p0 temp/leds1.bin temp/leds2.bin temp/leds3.bin temp/leds4.bin -o temp/leds_pack.bin
iceprog temp/leds_pack.bin
```

### BRAM (cont.)
Started figuring out how to load memory into the BRAM banks (modified from this [repo](https://github.com/damdoy/ice40_ultraplus_examples/blob/master/bram/implicit_bram.v)):
```verilog
module implicit_bram(input wire clk, input wire rd_en, input wire wr_en, input wire [7:0] rd_addr, input wire [7:0] wr_addr, input wire [15:0] data_in, output reg [15:0] data_out, output reg valid_out);

reg [15:0] memory [0:255];
initial $readmemh("demo_dat0.hex", memory);

always @(posedge clk) begin
	// default
	valid_out <= 0;
	  
	if(wr_en) begin
	memory[wr_addr] <= data_in;
	end
	
	if (rd_en) begin
	data_out <= memory[rd_addr];
	valid_out <= 1;
	end

end
endmodule
```
I used that module to have the LEDs light up with the first 4 bits stored in memory. 

I noticed that .asc files containing RAM information are the same size as those who do not. This suggests to me that iceprog is setting all the BRAM to 0 if there is no BRAM information. I tested this by modifying the asc for the memory->LEDs to not have any RAM information. Here all the LEDs lit up to 0, suggesting all the BRAM had been cleared.

In the icepack (converts .asc to .bin) documentation, I found that we can specify the option `-n` to skip initializing BRAM. I tried this out, and it worked. 

I now think we need to warmboot three things:
- Our memory control (does not init BRAM)
- Our neural network (does not init BRAM)
- A module that just initializes the BRAM
If the memory controller init the BRAM, then the  BRAM will return to a default state every time we switch back to the memory controller. However, this might be what we want if we want if we're only changing one parameter at a time. To illustrate the difference, the following show 2 parameters would look to the ANN if we update a to be 10 and then b to be 5:
> *separate module to init bram*
> a = 5, b = 10
> a = 10, b = 10
> a = 10, b = 5

> *memory controller inits bram*
> a = 5, b = 10
> a = 10, b = 10
> a = 5, b = 5
## Next
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
- BRAM demo working with warmboot: switch between warmboot images without overwriting the BRAM.
	- Two LEDs should indicate what image is active, while the other two are tied to two bits of memory (non-zero). Only the first two LEDs should change.
- Design a module that connects a RAM controller to UART
	- Confirm we can write and red to the memory using a serial interface
- Warmboot the above RAM + uart controller with another circuit that uses the values stored in memory.
