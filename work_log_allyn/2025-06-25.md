### Debugging the Memory Controller
Continued to work on debugging the memory controller. I added more information to the output of the python code:
![[Pasted image 20250625110652.png]]

I then wrote another python script to test all combinations of addresses (up to 256) and sizes (up to 16). Results:
![[Pasted image 20250625110747.png]]
Address is the y-axis (this pattern repeats every 16 addresses), and the x-axis is the size. A value of 0 indicates there was no error, 1: there was an incorrect number of bytes sent, 2: at least one of the bytes was wrong, and 3: both of the previous errors occurred. So, there appears to be two main problems:
- Does not read the correct size when the last 4 bits of the address are greater than the size
- Incorrect data is send for the first two addresses in a block of 16 (and some other places)
Upon further testing, it seems that the controller is also nondeterministic (if size: 15, address: 0 is the first thing polled from the controller, there are no issues.)

I ended up moving all the control logic into it's own module:
```verilog
module controller(
	input clk,
	input resetn,
	input wire uart_rx_valid,
	input wire [7:0] receive_data,
	input wire uart_tx_busy,
	input wire [15:0] mem_out,
	output wire uart_tx_en,
	output wire [7:0] transmit_data,
	output wire [7:0] mem_addr
);
```
I made a couple of cleanups along the way, and this somehow fixed the nondeterminism and most of the cases where the wrong byte was being read.

I fixed the remaining issue by rearranging the load states and adding an extra one. We need a load state after every uart receive, to correctly set NextSize/Addr, and then another load state after the last receive to read from memory.

I was later able to remove some of the load states by updating NextSize/Addr when NextState is, instead of the clock cycle afterwards.

Current controller code:
```verilog
module controller(
	input clk,
	input resetn,
	input wire uart_rx_valid,
	input wire [7:0] receive_data,
	input wire uart_tx_busy,
	input wire [15:0] mem_out,
	output wire uart_tx_en,
	output wire [7:0] transmit_data,
	output wire [7:0] mem_addr
);
  
reg [7:0] transmit_reg;
reg tx_en_reg;
assign transmit_data = transmit_reg;
assign uart_tx_en = tx_en_reg;

reg [3:0] CurrentState, NextState;
parameter COMMAND = 4'd0, ADDR = 4'd5, READ_MEM = 4'd8, T_SETUP_HIGH = 4'd1, T_HIGH = 4'd2, T_SETUP_LOW = 4'd3, T_LOW = 4'd4;

reg [7:0] CurrentAddrOffset, NextAddrOffset;
reg [3:0] CurrentSize, NextSize;
reg [7:0] CurrentAddr, NextAddr;
assign mem_addr = CurrentAddr + CurrentAddrOffset;

// Update current states and handle resets
always @ (posedge clk) begin
	CurrentState <= (resetn == 0) ? COMMAND : NextState;
	CurrentAddrOffset <= (resetn == 0) ? 8'd0 : NextAddrOffset;
	CurrentSize <= (resetn == 0) ? 4'd0 : NextSize;
	CurrentAddr <= (resetn == 0) ? 8'd0 : NextAddr;
end

// Update outputs
always @ (CurrentState) begin
	transmit_reg = 8'b0;
	tx_en_reg = 0;
	case(CurrentState)
		T_SETUP_HIGH: begin
			tx_en_reg <= 1;
			transmit_reg <= mem_out[15:8];
		end
		T_SETUP_LOW: begin
			tx_en_reg <= 1;
			transmit_reg <= mem_out[7:0];
		end
		default: begin
			transmit_reg <= 8'b0;
			tx_en_reg <= 0;
		end
	endcase
end

// Determine what the next state should be
always @ (CurrentState or uart_rx_valid or uart_tx_busy) begin
	NextAddrOffset = CurrentAddrOffset;
	NextSize = CurrentSize;
	NextAddr = CurrentAddr;
	case(CurrentState)
		COMMAND: begin
			NextState <= (uart_rx_valid == 1) ? ADDR : COMMAND;
			NextSize <= (uart_rx_valid == 1) ? receive_data[3:0] : CurrentSize;
		end
		ADDR: begin
			NextState <= (uart_rx_valid == 1) ? READ_MEM : ADDR;
			NextAddr <= (uart_rx_valid == 1) ? receive_data : CurrentAddr;
		end
		READ_MEM: NextState <= T_SETUP_HIGH;
		T_SETUP_HIGH: NextState <= T_HIGH;
		T_HIGH: NextState <= (uart_tx_busy == 0) ? T_SETUP_LOW : T_HIGH;
		T_SETUP_LOW: NextState <= T_LOW;
		T_LOW: begin
			NextState <= (uart_tx_busy == 0) ? ((CurrentAddrOffset == CurrentSize) ? COMMAND : READ_MEM) : T_LOW;
			NextAddrOffset <= (uart_tx_busy == 0) ? CurrentAddrOffset + 8'b1 : CurrentAddrOffset;
		end
		default: begin
		NextState <= COMMAND;
		NextAddrOffset <= CurrentAddrOffset;
		NextSize <= CurrentSize;
		NextAddr <= CurrentAddr;
		end
	endcase
end

endmodule
```

I started working on implementing writing, but did not make any concrete progress.
## Next
- Expand the memory controller
	- Support writing
	- Support multiple EBRs (right now I'm just working with 1 EBR of 4kbits, but the iCEstick supports up to 8 EBRs with 32 kbits)
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
