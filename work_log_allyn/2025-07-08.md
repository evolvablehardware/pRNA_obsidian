### Memory Controller Warmboot Demo
Continued working on my demo to warmboot the memoery controller with another circuit. I was able to get it mostly working, but the data I was receiving from the second circuit did not match what I expected. Eventually, I realized that the individual BRAMs were being placed at different locations across the two circuits (i.e block 6 on the memory controller was block 0 on the demo circuit).

To resolve this issue, I looked more in nextpnr's placement constraints (which i started looking into [[work_log_allyn/2025-06-13#Placement Constraints|here]]). However, I couldn't figure out what the syntax tiles for RAM should be. I could not find any examples online, and neither Google AI nor Chat GPT could figure it out. They also suggested that the syntax would be in specific parts of the iCE40 or icestorm documentation, but was not. Chat GPT said that the GUI version of nextpnr should have what I need. So, I tried to rebuild nextpnr with gui support, but first had to upgrade cmake and then deal with my dualboot running out of storage, since multiple copies of nextpnr take up a lot of storage. This took a lot longer than I was anticipating, but I eventually got it figured out.

ChatGPT also pointed out that I would need to explicitly instantiate the BRAM to use absolute placement constraints (I verified this too). I started working on switching over, but ran into a couple of road blocks:

The first location gets sets to all 0's, despite being initialized.
```

Sometimes the second half of a byte does not get written correctly

```

I do not know why there is a difference between implicitly and explicitly instantiated memory, and how to debug this. Maybe I need to make the state machine more robust by adding more stalls, so that there is enough time to read and write?

I might try playing around with implicit bram more, since that was mostly easier to work with. If I can't find a way to constrain the placement of the EBRs, I might be able to figure out a mapping between the EBRs of our two circuits from the outputs of the icestorm tools. 

I put my buggy code on a new branch (warmbooting_memory_controller) and reverted the main branch back to a working implementation to not make Brooklyn's life harder.

### TLDR
- When warmbooting, the location of the EBRs is inconsistent (solution: use placement constraints? hopefully?)
- There is almost no documentation on how to do placement constraints on nextpnr (solution: nextpnr's gui has more info)
- Explicitly and implicitly instantiated EBRs have different behavior (solution: tomorrow problem)
- Main branch of repo should no longer have buggy code
## Next
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
	- Debug memory issues
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
