### Cleaning up code
Merged the warmbooting_memory_controller branch into main and added more documentation of the code. One of the files got merged wrong, so I had to do some debugging and testing.
### Explicit BRAM
Played around more with explicit BRAM. Pages 77-78 of this [document](https://pages.hmc.edu/brake/class/e155/fa23/assets/doc/FPGA-TN-02026-3-2-iCE40-Technology-Library.pdf) were an useful reference. I first tried to identify what operations would most consistently cause incorrect behavior. I discovered that block 0, address 0 is pretty consistently read as 0000. Additionally, writing abcd turns into abcc, at any address. 

I then tried to simulate the explicit BRAM module. As expected, iverilog didn't recognize the SB_RAM40_4K primitive. The simulator needs a behavioral model of the primitive. Yosys provides this in yosys/ice40/cells_sim.v. However, I got syntax errors so it seems they are using syntax not supported by iverilog. It seems that there might be other simulators that could support the model. However, I realized that the model was just a wrapper for implicit bram. So, I don't think it's worth trying to simulate explicit BRAM.

I did realize while going through some documentation of the SB_RAM40_4K primitive is that the write mask is 16 bits wide and active low, while I had assumed it was 1-bit and active high. So, that seems to have fixed the write issue.

I then tried going through differences in the json files produced by yosys ([online diff checker results](https://www.diffchecker.com/aAfOWdtX/)). For the implicit one, the init data does not match what is stored in the hexfile and the read + write mode suggest our depth is 2048 locations that are two bits wide. But somehow, that's the version that actually works. My best guess is that  yosys somehow optimized the code so that all of blocks are being split among the tiles. I think this might have been caused my me doing instantiating the mem register as `reg [15:0] memory [0:256*NUM_BLOCKS - 1];` which basically means that all 16 blocks of mem are tied to the same variable. So, yosys has completed control over how that memory is split into blocks. 

I used my testbench tool to do a stress test of a single block of explicit bram. I confirmed the only errors come from when we read from address 0. However, I also discovered that once we write to the address, we can then read it fine. So, It seems that we can use explicit BRAM, with a single setup write at the start.
