### Placement Constraints
Worked on trying to figure out how to constrain BELs (basic logic elements) to certain tiles. This should hopefully help us rearrange the bitstream to put modifiable elements closer to each other, reducing the amount of the bitstream we have to erase and overwrite. All of the documentation I could find on it was this sentence on their [repo](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/blob/master/docs/constraints.md#absolute-placement-constraints):
> nextpnr provides generic support for placement constraints by setting the Bel attribute on the cell to the name ofthe Bel you wish it to be placed at. For example:
    (* BEL="X2/Y5/lc0" *)

No mention of where to place that syntax... I found this [example](https://fabulous.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FPGA-to-bitstream/Nextpnr%20compilation.html) of using it, but it seemed like there were other constraints going on, so it was confusing. The most I got out of it is that the syntax belonged in verilog files
```verilog
(* keep *) (* BEL="X11Y10.A" *) InPass4_frame_config Tile_X11Y10_A (.O0(Tile_X11Y10_RAM2FAB_D0_O0), .O1(Tile_X11Y10_RAM2FAB_D0_O1), .O2(Tile_X11Y10_RAM2FAB_D0_O2), .O3(Tile_X11Y10_RAM2FAB_D0_O3));
```
I tried playing around with it on my own, by placing the syntax in front of wire and gate declarations, but it did not make any impact. I asked Google's AI for guidance, and it said it could only be used with module instantiations. So, I created a module just for an AND gate, and it worked.
```verilog
module top (input [1:0] A, B, output [3:0] C);
.
.
.
(* BEL="X12/Y11/lc0" *)
  my_and_gate AND0 (
    .a(A[0]),
    .b(B[0]),
    .out(C[0])
  );
.
.
.
endmodule

module my_and_gate (input a, input b, output out);
  assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```
We now see logic was placed on the (12 11) tile: ![[Pasted image 20250613090003.png]]
Without the constraint it looks like: ![[Pasted image 20250613090049.png]]
### .asc to .bin Mapping
Created python script that modifies the first bit in each tile and uses the tool from yesterday to determine which address changes. This allows us to map each tile to one of the 4kB  subsectors in the SPI flash. I'm also storing in a .csv the exact adress of the first bit in each tile, for future reference.

I did only modify the first bit in each tile. I am assuming the whole tile is mapped to a single subsector, but I should confirm this assumption. 

However, depending on the size of our circuits, it seems likely we can avoid erasing and rewriting all subsectors each time we want to evaluate a new circuit. 

It seems like subsectors 6 and 7 are not tied to any tiles. I will have to research more and see what is actually stored in these subsectors. I did notice that each change caused 2 bytes starting at 0x7dd7 to change - the 5th and 4th bytes from the end of the bitstream. Not sure what that means. I'm guessing it might be some form of error correction, which might mean we also have to erase and rewrite subsector 7. 

I looked at the subsectors modified between two of our previously evolved circuits:
```
python3 find_patches.py test_files/evolved_circuits/AL2_2_9_24_pulse_40k/hardware1.bin test_files/evolved_circuits/AL2_2_9_24_pulse_40k/hardware10.bin output.csv

Found 89 patches with 95 bytes, out of a total of 32220 bytes.
Found modifications in subsectors: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
```
Subsector 6 is not modified and subsector 7 only changes in the two bytes at the end: 

| Address  | Num. bytes | New    | Old    | Subsector |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| 0x007dd7 | 2          | 0x0111 | 0xc62f | 7         |
### SPI Writing
Looked at the [datasheet](https://docs.rs-online.com/0866/0900766b80f7f8ab.pdf) for the Micron 32Mbit N25Q32 SPI flash (flash memory on the iCE40). It looks like erasing sets everything to 1, and changes from 1 to 0 can be made without erasing ([Reddit thread on why this is](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/ll4yah/default_value_of_flash_memory/)). Unfortunately, most of the bitstreams are 0. Maybe we could somehow add an inverter between the SPI flash and the FPGA chip in the HW, but this would mean everything would be inverted when using the SPI flash normally.

Interesting note on timing (PP instruction supports up to 256 bytes):
>For optimized timings, it is recommended to use the subsector program (PP) instruction to program all consecutive targeted bytes in a single sequence versus using several page program (PP) sequences with each containing only a few bytes (see Section 5.2.3: Page programming and Table 31: AC Characteristics). (p. 22)

There might be a way to suspend the erase operation so that we only erase the first part of a subsector, but it seems it would be hard to get the timing exact. Additonally, we cannot read or write to the sector if the erase cycle was suspended (p. 76).
> The bit 6 of the Flag Status register represents the Erase Suspend Status bit, It indicates that an Erase operation has been suspended or is going to be suspended. The bit is set (FSR<6>=1) within the Erase Suspend Latency time, that is as soon as the Program/Erase Suspend command (PES) has been issued, therefore the device may still complete the operation before entering the Suspend Mode. (p. 43)

There is some software write protection (described on p. 46) - hopefully we will not run into this.
## Next
- Continue to develop the bin differences tool
	- Possibly rewrite in C++
	- Knowing that a flash cannot erase anything smaller than a page, it makes sense to add a minimum patch size, or at least a way of figuring out how many pages will need to be overwritten.
- Continue to learn more about how/when the SPI interface can be used
- Continue to look at CTRNN resources
