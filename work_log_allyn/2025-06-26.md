### Memory Controller: Writing
Most of the issues I had were related to getting the simulation and HW to match up. In the simulation, it would occasionally go through multiple states on one uart_rx_valid pulse. I did not see this occuring when testing on the actual HW, I'm guessing due to lag. However, I did add a 'stall' state after every receive state, to make sure uart_rx_valid went low again before attempting to receive the next byte off the serial interface. 

I also realized that I was not checking if we received more bytes than we expected, which we were actually doing. I fixed this and added a check for it in the python code.

Most of the rest of my issues actually occurred in the python code. I was not formatting some bytes properly before sending them, and was not properly maintaining the local copy of the data (used for verification purposes)

### Changing the Clock Frequency
Did more more research into why I can only run the code at a fequency of 12MHz. It turns out next_pnr only checks if its possible to run the clock at that frequency. I will need to use icepll to generate a verilog module that converts the 12MHz clock into the desired frequency. 
## Next
- More work on the memory controller
	- Support multiple EBRs (right now I'm just working with 1 EBR of 4kbits, but the iCEstick supports up to 8 EBRs with 32 kbits)
	- Add in more documentation (focusing on the verilog)
	- Benchmark the operations (time + accuracy of reading and writing for various sizes)
- Combine the memory controller with a different circuit using warmbooting
- Figure out how to use the FPGA to modify the SPI flash in cases where we're not just modifying the BRAM
- Further iceprog optimizations
	- Being able to specify a list of bitstreams to upload, with a hold time for evaluation, so that we only have to init the FTDI once
