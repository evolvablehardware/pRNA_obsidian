### Work on build scripts
I continued to work on my makefile for building the needed tools for the picoice. I made progress on adding reset functionality, but it still seems like one of the nested submodules (lib/pico-ice-sdk/lib/pico-sdk) are not being reinit.

I also looked more at using cmake. This might be a possible path forward, as it does handle git submodules, but does not offer much control. There might not be a way add symlinks. I'm also not sure how this would work if we do end up using MicroPython instead of C.

Another option I looked at is pipelines. I'm not entirely sure what we would be pipelining though. We currently don't have any tests, and we're not deploying any code (unless we're counting uploading to the FPGA). I also think the build script just needs to be run once per machine, instead of every time we want to upload to the FPGA. 

### Using new FPGAs and APIO issues
The pico ices arrived a day early so I worked on getting set up with them. I was able to upload micropython easily, but ran into issues with programming the FPGA.

My first hurdle was getting APIO installed. When I tried installing it as a package, I found out I did not have a high enough version of glibc, which would have involved upgrading ubuntu, possibly taking hours. I was able to install it through pip, after upgrading my python from source. I was then able to build projects with apio, but not upload. 

Apio does seem to be able to find any product or manufacturer strings:

Which causes issues during uploading, as apio chooses which device to upload to in part due to the product string

I think part of the issue could be that pip installs from whatever is on the develop branch, which might not necessarily be fully tested as they are in between releases right now.
```bash
pip install --force-reinstall -U git+https://github.com/fpgawars/apio.git@develop
```

I tried instead installing from the master branch, which I think fixed the above issue, but created a new one:

Based on the printed help menu, I don't think --reset should be between -D and hardware.bin, but that's in the apio source code, so I can't really change that. Pip installing v0.9.5 caused the same error. I then installed from the second to last commit on the devlop branch, and ran into the first error. I could not find anyone experiencing a similar issue online.

I tried restarting my computer to see if that would fix the error and it did not. I also found out that my computer can't restart whenever the FPGA is plugged in, the screen goes black, but the fans and lights keep running and nothing changes.
