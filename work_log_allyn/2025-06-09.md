Meeting Notes
- ChatGPT conversation with possible resources to start with: https://chatgpt.com/share/6846dd38-5be4-8011-af48-b72d863dd28f

Set up [Obsidian Vault](https://github.com/rhit-loydma/pRNA_obsidian)
- Set up plug-ins: Git, Daily Notes, Calendar, and Templater
- Wrote README with brief description of how to configure the plugins

Read resources on optimizing the iCE40 compile time
- [[umarcor2021|Tools for exploiting warm/cold boot in iCE40 FPGAs]]: summary of existing work to load multiple (4+) bitstreams onto an iCE40 at once.
- [[Fritzsch2022|Reduction of Bitstream Size for Low-Cost iCE40 FPGAs]]: 5 methods for compactifying the iCE40 bitstream
- [[Hoffman2022|CoBEA: Framework for Evolving Hardware by Direct Manipulation of FPGA Bitstreams]]: using the techniques of the previous paper and bypassing the flash on the FPGA to improve reconfiguration time

Reviewed basics of CTRNNs
## Next
- The [[umarcor2021]] blogpost does not discuss how much faster loading multiple bitstreams at once is, so tests will need to be done to determine that.
- More research into the bitstream format
	- How is the bitstream converted into commands, such as the ones shown in [[Fritzsch2022]]?
	- Are there any other compactifications that can be made?
- Look more into constraints that can be applied during pnr to help control what parts of the HW can be evolved ([documentation link](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr/blob/master/docs/constraints.md#absolute-placement-constraints))
