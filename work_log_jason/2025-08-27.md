met with Logan and Ned and learned a number of things I had not understood previously. Most significantly, there is a need for an (likely embedded) surrogate environment to simulate a CTRNN controller's trajectory for fitness evaluation. This may take the form of a physics engine or CTRNN approximating a physics engine. This is something that is absolutely crucial for the whole system to work. Fortunately, this is going to be handled by Ned and Logan so its not something we have to particularly worry about.

The most immediate tasks for RHIT students/myself would be to get timing data on the speed at which we can read/write to the BRAM and SPRAM (from the RP, we have data for the PC). The planned architecture at this point would involve using the memory controller to write to the BRAM. 

To allow loading the next set of parameters from the RP we can stream the next network's configuration into the SPRAM. If we can then make it possible to write the SPRAM data into the BRAM we can hopefully make a very fast transition from one circuit to the next.

Revised R1 which is arguably complete for a first complete draft at this point.A few details to add in, but wouldb e good to get feedback and see if we can declare it complete and work on updated milestones and CoC.
