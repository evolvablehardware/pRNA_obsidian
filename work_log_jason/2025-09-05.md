## Log
- explored kanban for obsidian
	- might work well for individuals, but I think it would be a bad idea for groups
	- would be harder to allow Derek/Logan to easily check-in regularly
- github projects works well
	- defined outside of a repo which means we can have issues linked to specific projects
	- spent a lot of time populating some of the known todo tasks to migrate to the pico-ice boards
	- issues can have custom labels, assignees, roadmap view for timeline

## Next
- Discuss with Ned/Logan/Derek about the best contributions for the PRNA project if we are severely limited in the number of nodes that can be placed on the iCE40UP5K device.
	- There are some major directions things can head
		- focus on memory controller testing
		- focus on new toolchain/hardware setup
		- adapt the bitstream-evo codebase to the bitstream-evo-pico codebase
		- develop addition integrations (adder) for verilog demonstrations with the memory cotroller
		- work on getting warmbooting to function on the up5k devices
		- work on getting timing data for the pico <-> ice40 read/writes (should be much faster than the current timing data sent to/from host)
