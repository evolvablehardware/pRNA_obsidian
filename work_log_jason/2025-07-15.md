Warmbooting DOES work on the iCE40UP5K since this working demo uses the icebreaker board
https://github.com/sylefeb/Silice/blob/draft/projects/ice40-warmboot/README.md

and the icebreaker board uses an iCE40UP5K:

Notes on meeting with Derek here:

5K board how many neurons can we fit approximately?  ~50 or less

Which architectures do you anticipate? (i.e. How do the number of neurons scale with increased size?)

Fully connected ( N^2 edges)

How much space required for each neural/weight parameter? Is that adjustable?
24 bits per parameter, but is adjustable (bias, tc/tau, edge weights)
(rather than true TC, a value is stored which is  TC * integration step size)

For a concrete example
2 neuron network

Edge weights 4 (including self-loops) x 24 
TC/TAU  2x24 +   Bias 2x24
8x24 = 192

parameters network size *P(N)* = N bias, N Tc, + N*N edge weights  - 1 (input unit absorbed?  
  

To distinguish between roles of neural controllers:

PILOT - single neural controller running at slow clock speed and low power requirements
EVOLVERS - 1 or more neural controllers being evolved for fitness maintenance (seemingly 1 neural controller per a specific fitness metric (speed vs. x-position vs. balance, etc. ))


The amount of time between updates on the actual PILOT embedded controller?
Slow 1 Hz (boat)
Fast 100 Hz (drone)
IMU update (100-500Hz)
Fastest X kilohertz (auditory signals, not performed yet)


What is the evaluation time for different use cases?
Generally speaking, 1-2 seconds of sampling data is fed into the EVOLVER neural controllers which depending on the sampling rate might be 100 samples a second (highly dependent and may be across modality)
* the fastest modality would probably be used with repeated values for the slower ones?





Review of cobea suggested the possibility of using an existing evo framework to simplify things

DEAP seems like a robust choice (also what [cobea](sources/Hoffman2022) used)

The RAW cost for the ice40UP5K is actually under $10 if we do decide to make our own board in the future 
https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/lattice-semiconductor-corporation/ICE40UP5K-UWG30ITR1K/6173797

It is officially supported by icestorm whereas some other are not et:

```
The focus of the project is on the iCE40 LP/HX 1K/4K/8K chips. (Most of the work was done on HX1K-TQ144 and HX8K-CT256 parts.) The iCE40 UltraPlus parts are also supported, including DSPs, oscillators, RGB and SPRAM. iCE40 LM, Ultra and UltraLite parts are not yet supported.
