goals for today (@9:15-5:15 ):
* continue drafting R1 report
	* determine missing information
	* provide more information across the iCE40 family
	* developed tables for the speed up based on evaluation and swapping time
	* talked to Logan and Justin a bit, seems like something like underwater vehicle might have CRAZY slow updates so even 65ms to swap out CRAM would be fine
	* drone's might be more like 100s of nano seconds (call it 500ns or maybe 1000ns) to get a circuits outputs
	* It seemed like warmbooting only can be done on the LX and HX devices, not the UP devices  https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/225/iCE40FamilyHandbook-311139.pdf, but apparently it can be done.
		* The pico has less space, so we would have fewer images that could be loaded, but in principle can allow 
* Explore technical specifications for iCE40UP5K
	* CRAM in 65ms - partial possible? does not seem possible
	* BRAM vs. SPRAM
	* one developers overview repo for up5k: https://github.com/osresearch/up5k
	* 
* Evaluate development tools:
	* https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio
		* friendliest interface, seems configurable
		* under development will be releasing v1.0 within weeks according to the response to Brookyln's post to this google group: https://groups.google.com/g/fpga-wars-explorando-el-lado-libre
	* https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build
		* seems like a stack we might want to use
	* https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html
		* for RP pico - not likely, pretty limited
* Determine plan for Allyn/Brooklyn during my time off
	* 7-16 -> 7-19 
	* 7-21 -> 7-25
		* check-in Tuesday?
	* 7-28 -> 7-29

8-8-25 will be final day of work for Allyn
* should create a backwards planning for work priorities for them*

The code for writing to CRAM:

**pico-ice-sdk/src/pic0-sdk_ice_hal.c**
```
int ICE_HAL_ATTR ice_hal_spi_write(const uint8_t *buf, size_t len)
{
	int ret;
	if (!has_spi)
		return -EINVAL;
	
	if (is_pio) {
		for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {
			/* FIFO slots are 32-bits and the PIO state machine left shifts to get MSB first so need to
			* pre-shift by 24 bits to get bit 7 of data byte into bit 31 of FIFO slot.
			*/
			pio_sm_put_blocking(pio, sm, buf[i] << 24);
		}
			
		// Wait until the last byte has been pulled from the FIFO.
		
		while (!pio_sm_is_tx_fifo_empty(pio, sm)) {
			tight_loop_contents();
		}

		// At this point the last byte has been removed from the FIFO but the last bit might not have
		// been shifted out. Wait for the state machine to stall waiting for another bit
		// (which night never arrive).
		uint32_t mask = 1u << (sm + PIO_FDEBUG_TXSTALL_LSB);
		pio->fdebug = mask;
		while ((pio->fdebug & mask) == 0) {
			tight_loop_contents();
		}
	
	} else {
		...
		return ret;
	}
	
	return 0;
	
	}
```

If "tight_loop_contents()" is substantially faster than pio_sm_put_blocking(pio, sm, buf[i] << 24); then a smaller image will hopefully load faster than a larger one.

Report is coming closer to conclusion, starts with a deep evaluation of the iCEStick capabilities before pivoting to the pico-ice and adding in some justification on that choice versus the others. Can make a pretty solid case for it based on the capacities, cost, and community.
