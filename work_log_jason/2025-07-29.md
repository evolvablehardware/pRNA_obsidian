Reviewed notes from Allyn and Brooklyn

* Reminder on use cases:
	* RHIT - bitstream evolution - simple, maintainable
		* With new setup we can rewrite the arduino code to be C (or micropython if we find it easy enough)
		* even 200ms is acceptable and going lower cannot speed things up more than probably 50% increased speed for evaluation cycle (evaluation time is minimum 250ms)
	* Vivum - neurocontroller
		* swapping between neural architectures could benefit from speed ups and meaningfully since the evaluation time is potentially so low (100 us)
		* changing BRAM/SPRAM and only as much as is needed is the real place optimization can be beneficial
		* having a working model of the BRAM/SPRAM will allow development to start
Based on these uses cases my priorities are:
* USB
	* we need to have a faster transfer of data from a host machine to the fpga than what exists out of the box
	* Brooklyn is closing in on a full solution for this
* Implementation:
	* We need a working BRAM and SPRAM memory module in place and benchmark timing
	* Allyn is working on this and is narrowing down the problem

The rest of the Vivum office is facing an impending deadline, but once that has passed and there is a functional USB and BRAM/SPRAM module in place, it will be good to interface with Logan and start working on porting the Vivum neural controllers into the pico2-ice boards for some kind of demo.

The original research document I have been working on has gotten probably too large and I might try to rework that this week into a shorter document with appendices to make it more useful in the future.

I also need to get my development environment loaded here to interface with the picos. I can test Brooklyn's setup scripts. Should try to do that before he finishes Thursday this week.
