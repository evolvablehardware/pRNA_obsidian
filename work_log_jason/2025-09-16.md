## Log
- Idea for final report:
	- minimum for Vivum is just an internal 10-20 pages report
	- academic paper is great (would get all students on it)
	- website could be nice addition as well
- Good project for a website to give access for students to be able to update it
	- add to ehw org
	- create a github io page
- Made contact with Ben about squid and looked at the configuration a bit
- Confirmed with Derek plans to make it non-docker based to enable FPGA edge support
- Milestones updated via Derek
