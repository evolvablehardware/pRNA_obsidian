## Log
- standup
- worked on setting up payroll and paper work
- iterated on design ideas for the evaluation mediator
- met with glados team to discuss possiblities
- learned about SSE as a "cheap websocket" (but just 1 way communication for server to client)
- thought through a number of the types of requests we might want to make and how to approach
- requesting full access to a resource for an extended time would simplify life for glados, but if we can allow things to run for a long time and play nicely we can probably something more efficient that wont waste of freeze resources in the same way
	- reserve devices for duration  = guaranteed access, reliable runtime, maybe fast direct connection via usb to host machine (i.e. worker zero for glados)
	- handle requests on the fly = minimize wasted time, priority can allow intervention if you need to run something before everything else, might increase the overhead with the extra layers and need for design of a queueing system
