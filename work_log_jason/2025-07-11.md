"# How to program the FPGA CRAM?[](https://upduino.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/fpga_sram_programming.html#how-to-program-the-fpga-cram "Permalink to this headline")

The FPGA on the UPduino can be programmed by either programming the flash and letting the FPGA reconfigure itself after a reset (default) or by programing the FPGA under direct control of the FTDI part (CRAM programming).

The CRAM in the FPGA is volatile and so will not survive a power down. However, the programming is extremely fast (65ms) as compared to programming the Flash followed by a reset (>30 seconds). In applications where the FPGA may need to be reconfigured quickly and often such as under control of a processor, it makes sense to use the CRAM mode."

Possibly able to warm boot and utilize qSPI (4x speed) to switch between images even faster- might not be able to use the the Rasp Pi to do the CRAM rewrites if we are in warmboot mode.
