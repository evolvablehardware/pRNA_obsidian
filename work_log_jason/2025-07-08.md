* discussed the report with Derek
* meeting with Derek, Allyn, Logan, and Brooklyn
* worked on generating parts of the report as a white paper
* determined that the introduction and motivation can be generated relatively well and that parsing through Allyn's logs for the key bits of insight received and tested should be the most effective way to complete things
* Planning to have Brooklyn reproduce the same results from Allyn as a point of comparison for inclusion in the report. This will also make sense when having future students join and do on boarding to likewise contribute and do the same as a way to continuously validate the integrity of the tools and documentation.
* started working through all of Allyn's notes for integrating the most pertient details into the report which can be used as an onboarding document for future contributors as well.
