## Log
- Got very interesting results from the parameter sweep on the UP5K and then the subsequent checks for the EPC5
	- 
	- The ECP5 device has more support for DSPs and thus the board seems to be able to support a small number of LUTs, this could scale extremely well with a 12.5 or 25k device
	- ![[Pasted image 20250918154623.png]]
	- Need to track additional information on the make sweep script for Logan
- Met with Jackson had some good initial discussions
	- Jackson had been thinking of the server hosting the experimental platform rather than just a mediator
	- Since there is a lot of infrastructure in place I think the mediator role is a good starting point
	- Focusing on getting some initial hello worlds and benchmarking data is key
- Updated script to collect more of the data plot it for logan
## Next
- keep planning on design for distribution
- prepare more for onboarding for Mateo
