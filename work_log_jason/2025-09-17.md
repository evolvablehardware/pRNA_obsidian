## Goals
* [x] run sweep with Logan (order of 10-20 seconds per run)
* [x] determine scaling with regard to:
	* number of inputs
	* number of outputs
	* number of iterations/neurons
	* precision
* [x] Schedule meeting with Ben for next Tuesday
* [ ] Draft some design possibilities for pico-ice-farm
	* Review architectural options
	* Consider possible experiments
* [ ] Design plan for website
	* 

## Log
- script setup to run various scaling experiments
- pico-ice-farm
	- agree with Jackson's concept of an evaluation mediator
		- concerns are how to handle complexity of requests and queueing
		- priorities for design
- worked on scripting and visualizing fpga fabric searches
## Next
- run script with logan and generate plots to make conclusions
- continue iterating ideas for design for pico-ice-farm
- iterate on website concepts
- review status on rhit workers
