## Log
- Meeting with Ben, Jackson, Logan:
	- Squid does or could easily send data to the workers that could include information such as the current generation
	- Makes it feasible to run transfer experiments and otherwise with a well-designed interface, a distributed platform should be easily introduced
	- Squid currently is pretty specific on its assumption of a GA type algorithm, so if we want to have anything outside of the scope of how it was defined, that would be a limitation for what could be run
	- Squid is very simple to setup and run
	- Ben is working on some major refactoring with the time he has left to commit to the project
	- Glados can probably still have some advantages for flexibility and ease of experimentation, so a distributed system for the fpgas should make it possible to run from either squid or glados
- Worked on debugging things with Logan
	- System verilog to verilog conversion is creating problems
		- system verilog runs properly in simulation
		- verilog post conversion has problems
## Next
- continue debugging with Logan
- get example code for loading firmware without button pressed from Logan to share
