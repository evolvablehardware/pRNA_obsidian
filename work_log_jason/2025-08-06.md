currently making will result in the the build folder being deleted to ensure it works as desired


remove all files from the build directory
`# clean:`
rm -rf build/*
`# rm -rf rp_firmware/build/*`

Allyn's primary goal is to knowledge transfer to Logan

Getting timing data for the writes to BRAM/SPRAM from the pico will inform details of our design
1. timing the writes to the BRAM/SPRAM  10-30 microseconds according to chat gpt's estimation
	1. if we had a clever way to rotate through parameters from WITHIN the FPGA then I think we could update the speed of writes several orders of magnitude, but that would come at the cost of LUTs to define the code required to produce those changes...
	2. one of the RISC-V implementations is  <1000 LUTs so if there is a way to calculate the advantage of one option of the other that might be worth exploring
		1. fewer LUTs but faster swapping parameters
		2. maximized LUTs but slower swapping parameters
		3. This probably depends on (1) evaluation time of circuits (2) number of memory re-writes required
