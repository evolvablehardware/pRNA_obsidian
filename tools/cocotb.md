cocotb can be used to develop testbenches for verilog, but you can write the tests in python.


Here is an example for setting up a testbench with cocotb

This repo contains an example of a Vivum developed and open-sourced approach for creating a testbench.

One very useful task for the PRNA project would be to have a similar testbench developed for the memory controller in this repo:
