## Log
* Worked on getting benchmarking working in micropython
* Basic CRAM programming benchmark is significantly faster on the pico2 than the pico1 (pico2 second photo)

* All of the bitstreams are quite large for some reason, each exactly 106.5kb, only about 10 images will fit on the pico-ice at this size

* We will likely have to write our own data over usb pipeline anyway regardless of using c or micropython because whatever mpremote uses to copy data over takes an eternity (40 seconds to flash all the files for the multibitstream example)
