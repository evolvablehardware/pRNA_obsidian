## Log
- I found a magic number in the pico-ice-micropython-sdk that I think could maybe just like make everything 45x faster (was 1,000,000, I changed it to the max freq of the fpga flashing)
  ![[Pasted image 20250722115012.png]]
- Magic number doesn't change anything because flashing is currently managed by a PIO and not by the hardware SPI[ ]
- Clock speed is 37.5Mhz on Pico2 because that is 1/4 of the system clock.
