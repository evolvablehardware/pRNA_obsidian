## Log
- I found a magic number in the pico-ice-micropython-sdk that I think could maybe just like make everything 45x faster (was 1,000,000, I changed it to the max freq of the fpga flashing)

- Magic number doesn't change anything because flashing is currently managed by a PIO and not by the hardware SPI[ ]
- SPI flashing clock speed is 37.5Mhz on Pico2 because that is 1/4 of the system clock.
- Was able to get flashing frequency slightly faster, maxing out the flashing baudrate by overclocking the pico slightly  (to 180Mhz, so that 1/4 clock is 45Mhz)![[Pasted image 20250722160732.png]]
- Replicable issue where flashing takes more time for subsequent benchmarks?
