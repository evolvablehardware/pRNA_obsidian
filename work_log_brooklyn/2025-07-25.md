## Log
- decompression algorithm in [DMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberrypipico/comments/1lkr15n/super_fast_animation_rendering_on_the_pico_2/)
- I think this might be an example similar to what we're trying to [do](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb/blob/master/examples/device/cdc_dual_ports/src/main.c)
- more [info](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/130xlw9/usb_cdc_multiple_virtual_com_ports/)
- [Example](https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/blob/master/micropython/usb/examples/device/cdc_repl_example.py) in micropython maybe?
- One more [example](https://github.com/shekhuverma/Pyusb-RP-PICO/blob/main/device/main.c)
- Uncompressed:
	- Fastest time to get new full size new image onto pico minimum estimate: 
		- 1.5MB/s ->likely closer to 0.5MB/s real speed
		- Roughly 5 images/sec, roughly the same speed as we can stream them through the PIO currently (assuming we are not bottlenecked by Flash read speed)
- USB:
	- Bus is managed by the host so peripherals can't send stuff until the Host says to, so you write to one of the output buffers (one for each endpoint of each address on the bus)
	- Pipes (connections between host and endpoint(s)) specify the transfer type (control, bulk, iso, interrupt), bandwidth, packet sizes 
- Spent a long, long time reading through USB docs
