## Log
- Confirmed that the iCE40 fabric needs to be cycled between writing to cram, as it only checks the flag for flashing image on reboot, and that CRAM must be written serially in its entirety, doesn't seem to be any way to address it at all[ ]
- iCE40UP Clock stuff:
	- SPI clock 45MHZ max:
	- ![[Pasted image 20250714124325.png]]
- icecompr tool:
	- seems to only be for storage size? Must be decompressed before use I think
- Bitstream compression research paper tool:
	- decreased init time by a couple hundred ms in the ~2 runs done. otherwise unchanged, possibly worth looking into once we have implementations of the full scale hardware to be implemented on the boards.
- pico-ice:
	- Potentially slower than the ftdi chip? unknown until testing, tbd
