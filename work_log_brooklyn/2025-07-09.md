## Log
- Investigating whether there is an issue with the DIO between the two boards![[Pasted image 20250709115809.png]]![[Pasted image 20250709115745.png]]
- I properly set up the two boards for the demos in accordance with the readme
- Maybe look into Slave SPI mode? It could be a way to reconfigure the fpga repeatedly![[Pasted image 20250709134322.png]]
- The flash used is **Micron 32Mbit N25Q32** and the IO pins become accessible after the FPGA is configured
- Reconfiguration of the SRAM will not be possible on the iCEstick devices without removing the SPI flash chips and/or doing some very extreme reverse engineering into the opcodes involved in sram programming, definitely non-trivial, also probably not really more useful than just figuring out how to pack images into the SPI Flash
## Next
- begin to implement spi read/write from the fpga[ ]
- look into the Micron documentation for how to interface with the flash memory
