## Log
- Ran all of allyn's code on my system
- Memory access benchmark scaled the same on my laptop (although accessed significantly faster) ![[Pasted image 20250708124249.png]]
- Noticed additional dependency **ICEPNR-ICE40**
- Because we use the serial ports to interface over usb with the arduinos, significant snap reconfiguration would be required to use the snap arduino-cli package. Not viable anymore 
- Installed arduino-cli to /usr/local/bin using 
- $ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arduino/arduino-cli/master/install.sh | sudo BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sh
- both bram files fail to be placed due to 
	- "no BELs remaining to implement cell type '$scopeinfo' "
- As best As I can tell, this is some kind of diagnostic IP that is included in yosys and we are running into this issue because of version incompatability/outdated yosys 
- Confirmed that the issue was the packaged yosys/nextpnr incompatability in the ubuntu package repository. We need to (for now) be building yosys, nextpnr, and icestorm tools from source

## Next
- confirm build reproduceability in a linux container
- attempt to run all testbenches with updated yosys tools
-
