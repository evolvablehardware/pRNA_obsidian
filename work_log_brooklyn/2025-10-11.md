## Log
- All up5k bitstream files are exactly 104090 bytes[ ]
- Complete bitstream transfer in 118.198 ms [ ]
- Spent a very long time debugging what I thought must be an endianness/pointer/serial sending order bug, only to eventually find that everything was shifted 4 bytes because the example python code I used for the benchmarking script sent a "header" before the actual message

- We now have a working example of flashing a bitstream from a host in roughly 150ms 
## Next
* Improve the state machine on the host device to have a "measurement" step, and flashing of multiple bitstreams
* Comment out what the different light codes are
* Write a better (interrupt driven) function for blinking the LEDs to make the code WAYYY cleaner
* Make the python script a bit more legible and make it take in arguments instead of having everything hardcoded
* split some of the things on the example out into header files
* handle more errors in the state machine
* Do some preprocessor stuff with reporting out all of the log data from the pico vs not wasting the (negligible tbh) time
