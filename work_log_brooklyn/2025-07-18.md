## Log
# Packages:

- Developers responded promptly and civilly to a pull request, some of the build script is no longer necessary[ ]
- mostly today I just organized the new repo and fought git all day long
- no known way to achieve proper syntax highlighting/linting in an IDE for micropython
## Next
- ensure my small tweaks are implemented upstream
- work on getting benchmarks working for the pico and pico2[ ]
