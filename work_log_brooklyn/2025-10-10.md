- Soldered PMOD headers onto my board[ ]
- Investigating what makes some of the sample images viable for reboot/flashing without disconnecting cable and some not.
	- Currently I think it might be related to  the tusb config or CMAKE directives adding uart to stdio  ![[Pasted image 20251010125935.png]]
- Spent a lot of time on this and made little progress, skipping to usb transfers. . .
