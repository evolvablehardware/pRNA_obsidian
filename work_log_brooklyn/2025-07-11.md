- Pico-Ice: 
	- Uses micropython, lots of support and much easier to onboard people for I think:
		- "What is MicroPython?
		  MicroPython is a full implementation of the Python 3 programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware like Raspberry Pi Pico. You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately via USB Serial, and a built-in filesystem. The Pico port of MicroPython includes modules for accessing low-level chip-specific hardware."[https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html]
		- Things to note:
			- A single pin bridge would be required to read the analog values of fpga output
			- Their examples use APIO, which seems to be an attempt at an open source (still actively developed) user friendly wrapper of the YosysHQ toolchain

	- Example of micropython programming of fpga:
        ``` python
from machine import Pin
import ice
fpga = ice.fpga(cdone=Pin(26), clock=Pin(24), creset=Pin(27), cram_cs=Pin(9), cram_mosi=Pin(8), cram_sck=Pin(10), frequency=48)
file = open("bitstream.bin", "br")
fpga.start()
fpga.cram(file)
```
Example micropython for pulse counting:
```python
from machine import Pin
import time

# Define the pin for input signal
pulseInPin = Pin(2, Pin.IN)

# Initialize variables
pulse_count = 0
start_time = time.ticks_ms()

# Interrupt handler function to count pulses
def count_pulse(pin):
    global pulse_count

    # Increment pulse count on each rising edge
    pulse_count += 1

# Attach interrupt handler to the input pin for rising edge detection
pulseInPin.irq(trigger=Pin.IRQ_RISING, handler=count_pulse)

# Main loop
while True:
    # Check if one second has elapsed
    if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_ms(), start_time) >= 1000:
        # Calculate frequency
        frequency = pulse_count / 1.0  # Pulse count divided by time in seconds
        print("Frequency of Input Pulse:", frequency, "Hz")

        # Reset pulse count and start time
        pulse_count = 0
        start_time = time.ticks_ms()

    # Sleep for a short duration to reduce CPU usage
    time.sleep_ms(10)
```
