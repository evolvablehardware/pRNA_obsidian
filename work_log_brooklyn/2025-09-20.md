## Log
- attempted install of picotool using [this](https://piers.rocks/2023/09/05/installing-pico-sdk-and-picotool.html) guide
	- it worked installs properly to usr/local
- flashing a bin file took about a second, (so about 1 second for bitstream flashing)![[Screenshot from 2025-09-20 20-04-26.png]]
- now needs to be tested if thats a usb limitation (unlikely) or smth to do with flashing
	- this will require establishing usb transfers between pc host and the boards (next step anyway)
