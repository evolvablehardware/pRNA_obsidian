## Log
- Found a driver repo that includes a driver for the flash used on the board (N25Q32) (https://github.com/arm-software/CMSIS-Driver)
- Began looking into potential alternatives to the iCEstick:
	- iCEBreaker 
		- Community Board
		- iCE40UP5k
		- only empty pin slots and usb port
	- iCEsugar pro/nano/normal
		- iCEsugar pro and normal are NOT AN ICE40 (LFE5U instead)
		- up to 45k LUTs for the pro
		- programmed by copying file to the to the usb controller, has serial communication over usb from the FPGA, so testing could only be one cable
		- iCEsugar pro (25k LUTs) uses DDR2 mount. . .
	- pico1-ice & pico2-ice
		- iCE40 [iCE40UP5K](https://www.latticesemi.com/en/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40UltraPlus)
		- DIRECT ACCESS TO CRAM FROM PICO using SPI flash [https://pico-ice.tinyvision.ai/group__ice__cram.html#ga2cc2ec40d049cb2c844437a3d635fe1e]
		- less learning verilog :/, but definitely easier to teach people how to use micropython to add on to the sdk if they want
