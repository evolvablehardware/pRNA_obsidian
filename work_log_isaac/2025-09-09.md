## Log
- I edited the daily log template to make sure it was linking to other entries from withing the same folder.
- I set up obsidian to the spec noted in the [[README]].
- I created a template for setup, but I am not sure I like it yet, so I won't make a big deal out of it.
- I spent a bit of time trying to figure out what the issue Kanban Board meant and where my task was. I found it. 
- I spent a while trying to find CoCoTB, and I eventually found it, now I will try to install to WSL.
- I successfully installed cocotb and created [[Cocotb Initial Setup]].
### Meeting:
There was a meeting scheduled. I joined and no one was there. I started to set up obsidian
## Next
