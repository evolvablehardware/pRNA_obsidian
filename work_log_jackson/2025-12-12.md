## Log
- Fixed issue with manger
- Improved worker logging
- Got event communication working!
- PulseCount state works with sockets
- Worker -> client communication latency is very high, seems to be an issue with socketio client
	- client -> worker ~0.01 for file upload, worker -> ~4 for event packet
	- try changing runtime
	- I switched from using gevent to the flask development server, this fixed the issue. Need to find a new runtime now :(
	- eventlet is very very slow, not an option
	- can't keep using waitress, no support for sockets
	- gunicorn should work, and we no longer have a server running on the client so being able to run on a separate thread is no longer needed
	- Haven't really made any progress on this. Client connects to socket but worker does not seem to be aware of it. I'm just going to use the flask development server for now.
## Next
- Update PulseCountState since tempfile is no longer needed
- Move heartbeat.py functionality into main control server
- Add socket connection between client and main server to receive reservation status updates
- Update project req - sockets, gevent, remove waitress?
- Update examples
- Socket notifs on exit
- Resolve import issues
- Track down unnamed worker thread
- Move control to uvicorn
