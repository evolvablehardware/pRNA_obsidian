## Log
- Looked through Glados documentation
	- I think it's usefulness is going to be mainly dependent on how we want to make the system run in parallel, we probably should have a discussion on Thursday about it. If we want a architecture where fpga is running its own experiment, Glados seems to be a good way to go about it. Once the software for running single experiments is finished, all we would really need to do is switch from the configuration file to the Glados parameters. The UI would definitely allow us to run many more experiments than before. However, I think using Glados might introduce some significant restraints on the type of experiments that we can run. Since each compute node would likely end up being a fpga (or small cluster), we would limit our processing power towards evolving a single circuit to that, as the compute nodes can't communicate their results among themselves. I don't think this would really result in any big breakthroughs. Glados would let us run many times more experiments than we currently are, but it wouldn't really allow us to put more processing power towards a single circuit than we are already.
