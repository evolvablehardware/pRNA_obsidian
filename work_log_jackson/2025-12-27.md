## Log
- Deployment now uses pod id as worker name
- Fixed issue with ip parsing 
- Optimized image build caching 
- Explored network=host issue with worker. In order to receive udev events (kernel works fine) need to have access to AF_NETWORK socket, which can be done with network=host. This solution is not ideal because it means the container no longer has access to the overlay network. 
- Added worker log location configuration option, added log location in helm deployment
