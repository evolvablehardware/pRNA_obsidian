## Log
- Got usbip working from docker
	- **We can run the worker nodes through docker. However, the base image needs to be the same as the host machine, including approximate version. Also, usbip package varies by device.**
		- To be clear, the usbip installation requires device specific package. This does not effect the client.
		- This is inconvenient, but as long as we use the same os version and host device type it won't be a problem.
		- This also means I can finally set up some testing! 
- Fixed issue with file upload saving
- Messed around with docker swam
- Started to make a compose.yaml
- **Swarm doesn't support privileged mode** 
	- This is pretty annoying
	- It seems like there's a few open pull requests that add this, but have not been merged. We could use one of those, but this seems like a lot of extra complexity 
	- I don't really want to use kubernetes. All we really need is something to pull and run images, and this seems like overkill - we're going to be fighting task schedulers rather than benefiting from them since we care about specific nodes. We also have the requirement of exactly one container per host.
	- I'm considering simply running the containers individually with compose. This wouldn't be that bad with cluster ssh. Unfortunately I think this is the best option currently
	- Going to look into other services.
