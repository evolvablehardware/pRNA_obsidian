## Log
- Got usbip working from docker
	- **We can run the worker nodes through docker. However, the base image needs to be the same as the host machine, including approximate version. Also, usbip package varies by device.**
		- To be clear, the usbip installation requires device specific package. This does not effect the client.
		- This is inconvenient, but as long as we use the same os version and host device type it won't be a problem.
		- This also means I can finally set up some testing! 
- Fixed issue with file upload saving
