## Log
- usbip manager
## Next
- configure pyproject
- rewrite to flask (again)
- finish client lib
	- firmware flasher
- make client cl
- [teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) seems to be a good solution to the problem of usbip having no authentication and the community edition seems to have all the features we would need. It essentially puts the usbip ports behind a GH auth.
