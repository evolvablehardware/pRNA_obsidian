## Log
- usbip manager
	- major refectoring
		- separated control/worker/client into modules
		- switched back to flask (SSE no longer needed)
		- improved server abstraction
	- client
		- finished endpoints 
## Next
- make client cl
- client firmware flashing
- update req.txt
- update readmes
- create example
- [teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) seems to be a good solution to the problem of usbip having no authentication and the community edition seems to have all the features we would need. It essentially puts the usbip ports behind a GH auth.
