## Log
- While working to test the client cli, I encountered a strange usbip state. The bus was bound to usbip, but not listed under the available devices. From dmesg:
	- [137056.209200] usbip-host 1-1.2: usbip-host: register new device (bus 1 dev 111)
		[137576.519556] usbip-host 1-1.2: stub up
		[137576.924357] usbip-host 1-1.2: endpoint 0 is stalled
		[137576.931358] usbip-host 1-1.2: endpoint 0 is stalled
		[137576.939477] usbip-host 1-1.2: endpoint 0 is stalled
	- It seems that the device was bound, but some error prevented it from being available. I unbound the device, and the device manager correctly reexported it. I'm not sure what the issue was caused by. If it happens again I'll do some digging into where the error message originates from. 
- Initial client connection works
- Setup globalprotect on rpi, confirmed I'm able to setup a demo from here

## Next
- Add unbind event notifs to control
- Finish testing client notifs
