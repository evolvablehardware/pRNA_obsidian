## Log
- ramb tiles are active low, setting to all 0s does not disable them https://prjicestorm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ram_tile.html for 1k chips, 8k are active high. Not sure about 5k.
	- I looked at the asc for the blinky circuit in the pico examples. All of the ram tiles have a 0 for the enable. It appears that some of the routing goes through the ram tiles, but I am not sure any of the ram functionality is being used. Either:
		- Tiles are active low, toolchain defaults to active but does not use them
		- Tiles are active high, routing can still be used on the tiles without enabling thme
