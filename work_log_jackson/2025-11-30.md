## Log
- Worker defined functions for client to interface with are now typechecked
- Client can now upload files to worker defined functions, received as tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile
- Started pulse count driver
	- This will be an interface we can use for pulse count experiments. It allows the client to send batches of bitstream files and will send the data back through a event after they are evaluated. 
## Next
- Finish pulse count driver
- Add authentication to worker requests / client events
- Explore ELK for capturing worker logs
- Start a config file for worker
- I think once we have BitstreamEvolutionPico working, we can pretty much immediately move to a large scale. I have a example made for counting pulses over usbip already. Once the PulseCountState is finished, this will make things even easier - since transfers are done over http rather than usbip, we don't have to deal with device pass through in docker.
