## Log
- Working on usbip management system
	- Able to monitor all raspberry pi device changes and log in a data structure 
	- Able to automatically export all devices to usbip
	- Able to mark devices for firmware updates and automatically upload firmware
	- **not really sure where I should upload this**
## Next
- Add a function to scan for existing devices (currently just listening for dev events)
- Add another layer of abstraction over the current device manager. This will make it easier to maintain both a server for remote access and a util for local management. 
- Integrate into a command line utility for flashing local firmware
- Large amount of error handling
