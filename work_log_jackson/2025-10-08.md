## Log
- Fixed issue with BitstreamEvolution for up5k chips
	- I'm able to run in SIM_HARDWARE mode now with a up5k asc seed
	- It looks like we are currently limiting the logic tile rows we can modify to 1, 2, and 13 with a routing type of MOORE and 1, 2 for a routing type of NEWSE. I'm not quite sure the significance of these numbers, but I suspect they will have to be updated
- I was able to hack together the firmware I made and got an experiment running, it seems to be working fine. I'm getting 0.68 seconds of flashing/communication latency on top of the evaluation time. Tomorrow I'll run something longer.
