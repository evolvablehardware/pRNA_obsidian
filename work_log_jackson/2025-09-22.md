## Log
- pico2ices arrived!
- [fireworq](https://github.com/fireworq/fireworq?tab=readme-ov-file)seems to have the features needed for distributing tasks, however the documentation is pretty minimal and it has been abandoned for some time
- Getting mpremote set up
	- I had a similar issue to the one we had with the icesticks, where another process would take control of the dev file. In addition to removing brltty, I also had to remove modemmanager.
- Issue with bootloader on one of the boards (the first one I was testing!)
	- Tried both using sw1 and jumper on BT/G, but it starts the default blinky program
	- I'm able to start the bootloader by using mpremote, however I don't really want to upload anything since I need mpy for mpremote bootloader
	- Other two boards work fine, so I don't think its a setup issue 
	- dmesg [here](work_log_jackson/attachments/pico2ice_nobootloader_dmesg)
	- For now I'm just going to move on 
- apio is unable to find the device
	- When I specify a device using the -s flag, I get a warning that the flag is being ignored
	- I had to use apio install drivers serial in order for apio to recognize the manufactuer/product, which are MicroPython and Board in FS mode
	- when upload is run, it mentions that there is a filter for REGEX="^DFU FLASH". I suspect that this is running on the product field. 
	- Line 673 [here](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio/blob/79e10b1197c0ffe97fbd8cfd21afaa7182042501/apio/resources/boards.jsonc#L683) confirms that it is the case.
