## Log
- Read Squid docs
- Squid setup
	- The csv_data config option in the template config is somedata, Client.handle_save_data was trying to write to saved_agents/\[id]/data/data.csv and failing, so I changed the option to data and it seems to have fixed the issue. 
- Able to run template experiment

- [ ] Setup Pi for distributed experiment
- [ ] Figure out bitstreamevolution arch
	- I'm pretty sure there is a dockerfile somewhere?
