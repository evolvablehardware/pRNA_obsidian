## Log
- I've started to benchmark the accuracy of the GPIO interrupt for high frequency oscillators.  
- I've been using the previous firmware I made for experiments in order to do this
	- I've run into an issue where some hardware configurations do not load properly. I am able to embed these configuration in the firmware instead an run them fine, so it is an issue with the firmware I made. 
	- None of the fpga/cram operations return an error.
	- I'm hesitant to think it's an issue with the file transfer itself. The file sizes are the same, and different circuit configurations work/dont work consistently.  
	- I tried using Brooklyn's upload firmware instead, it works fine. It's much faster anyways, so I'm going to switch to using it. Still not really sure what the issue was through.
- Got pulse counter working
- Switched test script to new upload method
- Got benchmarker working. Going to start by going through all possible clk values at 2x increments, then focus on the 1-100khz range. 
-  [[gpio_benchmark_test_1]]
- I don't think we are going to have any issues unless we decide to go for greater frequencies. So far I have tested 1-64kHz with 5 tests lasting 10 seconds per integer interval. The most pulses dropped in a test has been 7. After this round finishes I'll probably move to greater intervals to find when greater error starts happening.
- [[gpio_benchmark_test_2]]
- Low Hz test. Sampled at approximately each integer 1-100 kHz. Tests lasted for 10 seconds each, error calculated as |expected pulses - actual|, and averaged.![[gpiotest_low_hz.png]]
- Higher Hz test. Includes datapoints from previous test, alongside a new set of samples. Sampled were done in 10kHz intervals, 5 times per interval, 10 seconds per test.![[gpiotest_all_hz.png]]
- Overall, this should be much more accurate than the nanos. I don't remember exactly what the error on the nanos were, but it was a rather significant percent measure. In the low kHz test, we're literally only losing a few pulses. 
## Next
- Adapters arrived - setup usbip demo on pi. I'm hoping to have this available for others to try by next meeting.
