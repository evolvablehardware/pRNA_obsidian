## Log
- Fixed issue with multiarch images needing separate deployments for each architecture rather than automatically pulling the correct one
- Verified k8 deployments work
- Tried running 3 picos on a rp5 to see if we would run into the udev issue, was not able to reproduce. Also tried using kernel events alongside user, using pyudev 0.24.3 instead of .4, and using python3.8.
	- Might be a udev version issue
- Hacked together a working version of [bitstreamevolution](https://github.com/heiljj/BitstreamEvolution) with icefarm
	- Currently only uses 1 device at a time, evaluating a single circuit across multiple devices is something that deserves better design. Going to add another pulse count client that evaluates circuits only once, giving them out to devices as they become available 
	- **starting with a 1kHz circuit I generated as a seed** (but outputs 5seconds worth of pulses so effectively 5kHz for fitness calculations), I was able to evolve to one outputting 10k pulses pretty quickly. Target is 40k so I'll see what happens. 
	- After ~10m PulseCountState got stuck waiting for a read, unresponsive to picocom - seems to be an issue with firmware. 
	- Client install was failing, had to install from local repo. I suspect that it's picking up setup.py instead of pyproject, which needs to be there for python3.8 support but does not actually contain anything yet.
- Added option to distribute circuits evenly across multiple devices instead of evaluating on each device
- Fixed bug where workers that had expired (not ended) reservations were not being notified of it
