## Log
- I started to mess around with Teleport. I was able to get connections working through docker containers. It looks like its an option we could use, I'm not sure if its the easiest to set up though.
	- Teleport by itself does not provide a security layer over TCP - it allows for isolation. It's pretty much a fancy VPN where a outside-accessible authentication service provides access to devices running Teleport inside the network.
	- The intended but least convenient method would be to set up a subnet with all of the usbip related devices inside of it. 
	- A kind of hacky solution we could do is set up everything normally, and then add fw rules to only allow tcp connections from the Teleport auth service ip. This would be a lot easier.
	- In the meanwhile I should be able to set up a demo using it
## Next
- I'm waiting on an adapter to connect the picos to a pi. Once this arrives I'll be able to better test the system.
