## Log
- Looks like a kubernetes daemonset will work in terms of privileged mode and one container per host.
- kubernetes things
	- for kubelet, need to remove disabled plugins line from /etc/containerd/config.toml and restart containerd.service
- I've been unable to get the device files mapped properly with kubernetes. I can map the volume and interact with them, but dev file changes are not reflected. I suspect that something is wrong with the way I am mapping volumes, perhaps they are just from privileged mode? I tried mapping other directions, and only *some* files would show up on the container. I think this is because minikube runs partially virtualized. I tried setting up kubeadm, having a rpi specific issue enabling cgroup memory though. For now I plan on just using pdsh to pull and run containers. This feels kinda bad but I don't think it makes too much of a difference. We already have to carefully manage stuff on the host for usbip anyways.
