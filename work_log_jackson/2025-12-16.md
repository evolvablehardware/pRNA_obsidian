## Log
- Using swarm
	- Adding permissions with cgroups to swarm services is not supported. Have not been able to get permission to access devices, but I am able to hotplug the dev files. Currently only lead is [this](https://github.com/moby/swarmkit/issues/1244#issuecomment-285935430), but it does not seem that docker uses this cgroup entry anymore
	- There are many various pull requests that include an addition of privileged mode. We could use one of these. However, compiling these are quite annoying since it requires both dockercli and swarmkit forks
	- Still going to make a compose - this will make development and testing easier. 
- Looking into k3s
	- I was able to solve the memory cgroup issue from earlier, which was preventing me from running k8s on rpis 
	- Going to see if this is a simple enough alternative. 
	- Initial impression is that this will work well
	- Able to just add privileged mode
	- k8s containers are also easier to address
