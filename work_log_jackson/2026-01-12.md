## Log
- Firmware issue seems to only occur when running bitstreamevolution as opposed to the example
- Was able to figure out issue. I was able to produce a circuit that seems to crash the pico on one specific device, other two are able to flash it fine. I need to do more testing to figure out if this behavior happens to other picos. I suspect this one may just be defective in some way.
