## Log
- Looked into Helm, think it might be best option. Going to give it a try. Planning on removing usbip related stuff. Planning to move firmware paths to static value in state file for now. This doesn't belong in config, as this is really build metadata instead. While this is a terrible design, there's no quick way to declare build location inside the state, so leaving as is for now. If Helm works out, I'm considering trying out ELK again. Need to setup actions for image stuff. Need to rename stuff to iCEFARM. Need to change worker startup behavior to behave while on container restarts.
