## Log
- Workaround for docker swarm privileged mode
	- Start first container, expose /var/run/docker.sock
	- Run docker in first container (can include privileged flag)
	- The downside of this is that the second container runs detached from the swarm. We can bind the status of the second container to the first by listening for sigterm and shutting down the second container when it is received. 
		- might be able to use -rm with interactive session, need to test this
	- For now going to continue to use pdsh. Still planning on doing kubernetes eventually.
	
- pdsh deployment script
	- this needs to be replaced, works for now
- reflashed pis to same version
- deployments working well!
