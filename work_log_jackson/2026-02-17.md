- Firmware/state for variance experiments
- Ensure BitstreamEvolution works properly with variance
- Make BatchRequest interface easier to implement, then finish writing extension guide
- Continue to experiment with different multi device fitness functions
	- Trying cubed error instead of square
- Pulse graph is useless when there is a high pulse circuit due to scaling. Change to log? 
	- Oops looks like the histogram is broken again! Guessing this is from using multiple devices
- Reservation end bug still exists. I'm sort of at a loss for what is going on here. 
	- Client:
		[EventServer] [socket@http://localhost:8080] received reservation end event
		[EventServer] [socket@http://localhost:8081] disconnected: client disconnect
		[EventServer] [socket@http://localhost:8080] received reservation ending soon event
		[EventServer] [socket@http://localhost:8080] received reservation ending soon event
		[EventServer] [socket@http://localhost:8080] received reservation ending soon event
		reservation for 1B66CE91AB184A50 ended
		refreshed reservation of 1B66CE91AB184A50

		[Control] [ControlEventSender] [EventSender] [bitstream evolution] flushed 2 events

	- I have logging for the reservation triggers and I have confirmed that it does indeed log as intended. In addition, two events are indeed flushed. It appears that at some point an rouge reservation end is being inserted from somewhere (heartbeat module?) without any logging attached to it. I searched everywhere for possible reservation end triggers but could not find any out of place. Added additional debug logging to event sender, logging individual events now.
