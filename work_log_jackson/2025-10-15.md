## Log
- Working on usbip manager 
	- Thinking about it some more, there is still one issue that happens within usbip: when a device temporarily disconnects, the client will have to reconnect again, which is annoying. My plan for addressing this is to include a subscription address in device reservations, which the host sends notifications to whenever a device is rebound to usbip. The client will just host a server that automatically connects to devices when the notifications are received. 
		- With this in place, I will plan to stop including a separate functionality of flashing firmware as part of the worker node; this is out of place of the rest of the project. Instead, I'll make a client for flashing over usbip - the problem with having to reconnect during firmware flashing will no longer be an issue. 
	- test script for detecting usbip disconnects working
	- Implemented the better disconnect protect into the manager
	- Added arg for local mode
	- Added a subscription for devices being exported - this allows devices to automatically reconnect after the device temporarily disconnects, such as when going into the bootloader. I still need to make the interface to actually use the functionality, but I got it working.
