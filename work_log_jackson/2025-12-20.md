## Log
- Added batch uploads - if devices are located on the same worker, you can send send a single command and have it replicated across multiple devices. Slightly faster circuit evaluations!
- Changed device/state lock system to be much more stable, however this significantly increases **firmware** upload times
	- **Bitstream upload time is unchanged**
	- I'm not sure how well usbip will work with this one, though it probably doesn't matter. While the old lock system did a terrible job at keeping track of the actual device state, it was a necessary evil to ensure that the most up to date usbip actions were performed.
- Client reservation only returns after devices have finished initializing, no more waiting unnecessarily
- Need to do some hardware benchmarks at some point. My usb hub is adding some evaluation time
	- 103 circuits, 0.27s per circuit latency including flash
