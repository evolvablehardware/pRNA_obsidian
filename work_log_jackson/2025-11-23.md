## Log
- Physical device identification
	- I found a util for managing usb port power, but I was unable to turn the status led off from rp4 ports
	- Supposedly they conform to the spec that the tool uses
	- It's not worth finding specific hardware for this functionality 
	- Should not be as bad as I originally thought, all we will need to do is press the button and plug the device back in. That is, we don't have to reflash the firmware with a different device.
- Working on worker refactor
	- This makes devices much more abstract. It essentially will allow us to define classes for how we want to use a device and then automatically generate a client for interfacing with it. As a result, we will be able to create a specific device class for firmware we commonly use (such as pulse count) and be able to solely communicate through the event server without needing usbip. 
- Control/Analytics panel
	- I found [this](https://refine.dev/) which looks promising. Still looking for other options though. 
	- Going to be working on this next - want to have the current feature set working with the worker refactor first so I don't have to go back and rewrite it later
## Next
- Set up demo again tomorrow
