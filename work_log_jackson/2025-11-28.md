## Log
- added back usbip disconnect in worker refactor
- finally split notificationsender class
- finished client refactor for worker changes
	- Device and client behavior is now much more abstract. This change allows us to communicate through other means than usbip. For example, we could make a Device class specific to evaluating a bitstreams pulse count that sends the bitstream over TCP. This will save additional time for stable experiment firmware.
	- Interactions between the workers and client is also now much easier. We can decorate methods on the Device objects to allow them to be remotely called from the client.
- started updating examples with client changes
## Next
- Test heartbeat changes
- Make pulse count driver example
- Update docker example to include actual evaluation instead of just environment 
	- Figure out how to avoid using --network=host
- Authenticate events
