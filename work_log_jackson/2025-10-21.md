- Usbip security considerations
	- Usbip allows anyone to connect to the exported devices. We don't want this on a large network, even if its "secure". Traffic is also encrypted. 
	- I have no experience doing networking things, so this might be a terrible approach. That being said, ssh tunnels seem like they could be a good solution to this. It provides both authentication and encryption without having to modify usbip at all. It seems like the most annoying part about this approach would be managing all the keys.
		- In terms of managing keys, the most convenient approach would be to have a dedicated server that forwards connections to each of the device servers. This way each device server only needs to have the key of the dedicated server, and to add a new user we would only need to add their key to the dedicated server.
		- The first downside of this approach is that it another network jump. Probably fine on a local network?
		- A larger one is that the device servers no longer know the address that is used to access them. This is a problem because it means that the device server cannot update entries in the DB of what ip to connect to for usbip. 
		- This can be solved by maintaining a map of which port goes to which ip in the DB when adding extra connections.
