- usbip manager
	- I've been working on a system for confirming that devices can be flashed to again after they are done being used. This is done by trying to upload a default firmware and confirming that the correct message is being printed through stdio. I've observed that some of the devices exported by the pico2-ice take a unusually long time to close the file descriptor, sometimes taking more than 10 seconds. This behavior is inconsistent across the same firmware and only happens occasionally. It's mostly fine, just means that occasionally a device will take longer to be ready to use, something that rarely needs to happen. I'm more worried that at some point fd may not close, causing a device to be stuck in a testing state rather than being marked as broken.
	- Finished default firmware system
	- Subscription callbacks from worker to client about usbip
	- Refactored into worker/control-server folders
	- Updated installation instructions
	- Started work on new client
