## Log
- After spending time reading icestorm docs to create the seed circuits, I am very convinced in addition to it being possible to evolve multiple circuits on the same board, I don't think it would be nearly as challenging as it seems.
	- First, we would have to split the board into different sets of tiles, maintaining a 1 tile buffer around
	- We use this buffer to connect each set of logic tiles to a different pin. This certainly would be annoying to hand route, but its not necessarily difficult.
	- The key here is to change the circuit representation of the routing bits. Instead of using bitstrings, we enumerate the possible span connections for each group of routing configuration bits. The other bits can still be treated as bitstrings. This allows us to easily prevent wire connections from happening by just removing that option. For each set of logic tiles that we are evolving on, we can go through the enumeration of span tile connection options. If the tile connection is related to a global net or a tile outside of the set, we can just remove it.
