## Log
- client firmware flashing working
- made client cli
- various fixes
## Next
- update readmes
- create example
- [teleport](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport) seems to be a good solution to the problem of usbip having no authentication and the community edition seems to have all the features we would need. It essentially puts the usbip ports behind a GH auth. 
- Planning on doing pico GPIO benchmarks to test system
