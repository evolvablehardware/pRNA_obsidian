## Log
- Working on detecting the strange usbip state
	- On the client slide, when the strange state happens there is no event disconnect for the dev files. I probably should have expected this considering they still show up under /dev. This means were going to have to check usbip port to see if devices are still connected. The good news is that the add events still work as normal, so we should not have to run this frequently.
- I noticed that the client class was getting pretty large, got super sidetracked and did a refactor
- Reorganized utils
- Created events for the timeout detection
- Now detects timeouts and reconnects! Even with the high latency over globalprotect I am able to upload firmware, albeit rather slowly
