## Log
- usbip manager
	- Added system for automatic reconnections
	- Updated cli
	- The system is pretty much ready for use. Right now the main limitation is that there is centralized place to track all of the remote devices, it is done by each server individually. This is my next goal, but I want to make sure that this type of system works first.
## Next
- Some more testing
