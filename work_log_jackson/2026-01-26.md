## Log
- BitstreamEvolution refactoring
	- Created ABC for Selection methods
	- Moved selection methods in CircuitPopulation to new Selection module
	- Circuitpop down 400 total lines
- Created RemoteCircuit for using iCEFARM, moved env variables to config values
- Restored previous modifications to make iCEFARM work. Everything should be able to run fine without it, but I am unable to test it myself.
- GA thoughts 
	- I think sometimes that having elitism might be counterproductive, as our diversity is often rather low. It may be worthwhile to look into a selection method that only allows selects elites that are diverse enough
