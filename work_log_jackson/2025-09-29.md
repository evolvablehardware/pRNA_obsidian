## Log
- Try to measure an oscillator circuit using gpio
	- I'm able to toggle a pin using gpio and print back the events
	- Having trouble reading fpga output though
	- I switched from using events to simply polling the pin to simplify things. I also switched to just assigning a 0 value to the fpga pin instead of a clock. 
	- I can change the ice40 setup to instead forward the pin to the led, and it works, so I know that I am trying to read the correct pins
	
	- Procedure
		- Assign pin value to 0 in fpga
		- Set pin to output, output 0.
		- Change pin to input
		- Read pin
	- Result
		- The pin is read as 1 if pulling up and 0 if pulling down
	- Not really sure what is happening here
