## Log
- Experiment issues
	- I tried evaluating random bitstreams for about an hour and was not able to get any pulses, I used a seed file that connected the leds and a pinout to sw2.
	- I remembered a conversation about mutating bits related to spans. After using [this](https://knielsen.github.io/ice40_viewer/ice40_viewer.html)tool to inspect the randomized circuits, I realized that this was probably the issue
		- ![[seed_routing.png]] This is the original seed I was using. You can see that the three leds and a pinout are connected to the switch
		- ![[seed_routing_mutated.png]]This is one of the circuits that had the bitstream randomized - there are now many look up tables that are apart of the bitstream. However, none of these are actually connected to anything, as the span remains completely unchanged. I think that the default config misses the columns for this, but I'm not sure. I thought I understood how the logic tile configuration worked, it seems that some of the span connections are not directly listed in the documentation.

## Next
- Confirm that the current columns do not allow span/tracks to be modified, if this is the case figure out what columns we should add
