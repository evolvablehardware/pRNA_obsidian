## Log
- Met with GLADOS team, went over BitstreamEvolution and iCEFARM integration. Plan is to get BitstreamEvolution working in FULLY_SIM mode, since this will indicate that the icestorm tools are working correctly and we don't need to worry about device evaluations anyway. iCEFARM is just additional pip dependencies and needing to be able to connect to websockets now that were not using usbip
- Planning:
	- Reflecting on k3s yesterday, I think it may be the best option. It was incredibly easy to set up. Now that I know its an option, going to stop focusing on deployment for a few days
	- Mainly going to focus on preparing sockets branch for merge. Still need to:
		- Test usbipstate (and probably fix bugs)
		- Update examples from old clients
		- Update documentation 
	- I'm also realizing that I could make the development environment a lot better
		- Even though I'm planning on using k3s, I'm going to make a compose file for running control/worker locally 
		- I should cleanup and publish my .vscode folder for the repo
	- I need to add a tutorial for making new device states and clients. While the system is incredibly extensible, it also relies on a lot of magic to make that happen
