## Log
- Goal: Ensure that we can modify Squid to support fitness functions that act on the data of multiple fpgas
	- This seems to be part of the Broker.experiment functionality
		- Note: refactor planned for broker
	- Definitely possible, I'm pretty sure I can figure it out
		- Might want to do this first as proof of concept? Refactor will mess stuff up, but don't want to do the part that might not work out last
