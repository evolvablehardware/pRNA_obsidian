## Log
- Working on new bitstream sending system
	- Got everything working, still need to update tests to use new system
	- Now have fine grained control over where circuits should be evaluated, results are received from a generator function.
	- Also have better control for when circuits are sent. Currently using an implementation that starts by sending a set amount of circuits to each reserved device. Once a circuits remaining threshold is reached, new circuits are sent to the workers. This maintains a buffer of circuits so that the device can always be evaluating, but does not overwhelm the worker with a sudden influx of files.
