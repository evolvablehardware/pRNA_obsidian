## Log
- Confirmed circuit issue only happens on one device with the specific circuit from yesterday 
- I found another circuit that breaks all 3 devices when used with iCEFARM. I made firmware that embeds the bitstream, uploads to fpga, and prints using this circuit. On one device, I could no longer read from the serial port. On the other, the serial port worked fine. The one that worked fine was the same device as the one that broke with the previous circuit. I did not test with this firmware on the third device as that is the one with the faulty button (its fine to use bitstream over usb as it boots into a okay state).
