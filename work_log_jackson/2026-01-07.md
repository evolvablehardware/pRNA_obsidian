## Log
- Working on a new system for sending requests to workers in the client. 
	- Previously, you could either send a circuit to each worker to be evaluated, or distribute a list of circuits among different workers. 
	- The main logical hurdle is efficiently sending circuits to the worker - if you are evaluating a bitstream on multiple picos located on the same worker, the bitstream should only be send to the worker once. In addition, large amounts of circuits should be sent over multiple requests. 
	- New system takes circuits and which serials each circuit should be sent to. It ensures that minimal file transfers are done. It also maintains a number of circuits queued in each worker, rather than sending all of the circuits at once.
