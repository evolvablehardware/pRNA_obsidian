## Log
- Rewrote FileBasedCircuit.mutate in rust, takes <0.01s with 0.5 mutation chance (worst case branch pred) on all logic tile locations.  I'll do the same for crossover if it is slow but have not benchmarked it yet.
	- https://pypi.org/project/ascutil/
	- https://github.com/heiljj/ascutil
- Updated fork to use ascutil 
- Added pypi workflow for icefarm
- Crossover time is fine. I'm not really sure why this is so much faster than mutation.
- Ran cprofile, only significant slow call was for waiting on iCEFARM results, which is expected
- Now that circuits can be built much faster, I am interested in how important the evaluation time is
