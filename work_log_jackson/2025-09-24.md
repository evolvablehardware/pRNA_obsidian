## Log
- Started POC for managing devices
	- going to use pyudev
	- my first goal is to create a system that listens for device events and maintains relevant information about connected fpgas. pyudev is going to make this incredibly easy  
- Try to get dfu-util working to ensure compatibility 
	- dfu-util doesn't list any devices (aside from camera), says device is not dfu capable if I try to target the device anyway
	- used [this](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/tree/pico2-ice_develop/examples/rp2_usb_uf2) firmware and it worked
- I got a POC working using [this](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/tree/main/examples/rp2_hello_world) firmware that allows new firmware to be flashed without having to do any button pressing/power toggling. I'm not sure where the best place to put this type of thing is.
	- It does not work out of the box on the same firmware that allows the ice40 to be reprogrammed. My understanding is that the tinyusb configuration in that firmware is set to expose the ice40, while the one I am using is set to expose the rpi serial. I am not sure if it is possible to support both - this would be extremely annoying once we are trying to get data back. I am going to spend some time working with tusb and try to figure out how the configuration works.
