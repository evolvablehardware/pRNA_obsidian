## Log
- FPGAs expected to arrive on Wednesday
- Read pico2-ice docs
	- The memory exposed to the host is for the flash, which is copied into the cram when the ice40 reboots
	- Micropython supports a useful set of [remote commands](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html#mpremote-command-sleep), such as one to run python from the local filesystem. One such makes the device enter its bootloader - I wonder if this command could be used instead of toggling the power after uploading a bitstream file. We can also use mpremote to [upload the bitsteam](https://pico2-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_programming__the__fpga.html).
		- Why is toggling power necessary when using Micropython? It doesn't seem to be needed when using the SDK api, only the ice40 should have to reboot anyway?
			- Appears just to be a convenient way to reboot the ice40 without the user needing to upload code
		- I suspect we could just use Micropython to first copy the bitstream to the pico's fs then execute a python file which can be on the host machine to actually [upload the bitsteam to CRAM](https://pico2-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_mpy.html), without having to reboot
			- It might be worth doing some benchmarks on how much time mpy adds to reconfiguration, this would be a lot more convenient than working with usb transfer stuff in C. It doesn't look like there is any support for usb stuff in mpy for pico, but we could always write output to a file and copy it over with mpyremote
			- **mpy supports connecting to devices using [serial over TCP](https://github.com/cminyard/ser2net)
	- The mpy ice api is listed [here](https://pico2-ice.tinyvision.ai/md_mpy.html), but I've been unable to find any other documentation
		- source is [here](https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-mpy-module/blob/000ae94d480786e26acebacbdc5aa11b3918f8f3/ice_module.c), contains a few additional functions for interacting with flash
