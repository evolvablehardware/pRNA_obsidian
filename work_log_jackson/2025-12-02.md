## Log
- Added configuration file option for worker
	- Need to figure out best practice for database access. Right now passing libpg connection string as env variable. This is probably fine for our use case?
- Moved usbip disconnect detection from EventManager to UsbipState
	- This causes a bunch of monitor-observer threads to be created. This should be fine, these are all event based so should be sleeping most of the time. If this causes performance issues I plan on making a global MO service. Having it in the DM created too many method chains.
- Moved all firmware to worker/firmware, removed firmware from examples
- Build script for building everything
- Working on getting worker running from a docker container, waiting on build
- Worker seems to be mostly working in the docker container! 
	- Need to update busid parser
		- This is specific to rp5 
	- Somethings wrong with the file upload system, I suspect I'm missing a dependency for the tempfile module
- New parser
	- udevadm info devpath --attribute-walk shows what we need?
	- It looks like this can be fixed just by changing the regex from the previous one. This is something to keep in mind for the future as we run on different devices though.
