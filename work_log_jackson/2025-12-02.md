## Log
- Added configuration file option for worker
	- Need to figure out best practice for database access. Right now passing libpg connection string as env variable. This is probably fine for our use case?
- Moved usbip disconnect detection from EventManager to UsbipState
	- This causes a bunch of monitor-observer threads to be created. This should be fine, these are all event based so should be sleeping most of the time. If this causes performance issues I plan on making a global MO service. Having it in the DM created too many method chains.
- Moved all firmware to worker/firmware, removed firmware from examples
- Build script for building everything
- Working on getting worker running from a docker container, waiting on build
