- Everything for iCEFARM should be setup now (except for pypi org change, don't think this will require changes since github repo based auth)
- seed stuff
	- Should be clk disabled for everything now, but mutation will add clks in logic tile 	- ![[Screen Shot 2026-02-13 at 19.17.07.png]]
	- just need to stop these connections?
	- -![[Screen Shot 2026-02-13 at 19.23.02.png]]
	- Should just be able to remove (0 based) cols 0/1/2. Interestingly, I'm not mutating on those columns in the first place. Perhaps it is truly already disconnected or maybe I am missing a clock somewhere else. There's also the possibility of logic tiles being significantly different. This is 2.5 for 8k (no 5k for ice_html). I was able to get a pulse rather quickly, so I had assumed there was a clock connection still. Going get another initialization created circuit and inspect for clk connections.
	- I'm remaining skeptical that I did everything correct, but as far as I am aware this is functioning without a clock so long as cols 1,2,3 (1 index) are avoided for the above reason, and cols 8,21,50,51(1 index) are avoided since they contain bits with unknown effects. It's possible that maybe the IO tile contains clk stuff that I'm not aware of.

<B6[2]> IoCtrl REN_0
		- First two is just span4vert -> dout, which is normal as thats connecting to pinout
		- REN_0 is enabling pull up resistors per project icestorm io tile docs
		- cf_bit_39 is listed as unknown, removed this bit, still able to get pulses
		- I was able to still get pulses after removing pintype_0. Was not able to do the same for 3/4 after 50 circuits
## Next
- pypi asutil auth update
 - Make BatchRequest module easier to implement on new clients
	- Planning on \_evaluateBatch protocol + managment for multiple requests
- Guides/readme changes
