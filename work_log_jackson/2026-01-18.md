## Log
- I switched over to PIO pulse counting at some point (yesterday?). I still need to do a full benchmark of its accuracy, but it performed fine at 1-4khz and it would be astonishing if it was less accurate than IRQ. 
- I was able to run experiments now that the crashing issue was fixed![[pulse count experiment.png]]
	-  The only iCEFARM issue I ran into was that the reservation duration was not automatically extended by the client, so if I had not manually extended it the reservation would have expired
	- This was done starting from a generated 1khz circuit, targeted at 40hkz. 3 devices were used, circuits were evaluated on a random device for 1 second (probably why the average is so low - also had a high mutation rate). Each generation of 50 circuits took about 20 seconds to evaluate, not including circuit compilation times. 
	- I think circuit compilation time is going to become the next bottleneck, assuming the oss suite is properly multi threaded - if its not we can just compile multiple at once and problem solved. I only was using 3 devices and it felt like compilation was taking a good percentage of time. That being said, in the future we will have proper fitness functions for evaluating across multiple devices, resulting in more evaluations per compilation.
	- After running the last generation through again, it seems that the best circuits were about 41khz. The best performing circuit overall was 39988hz in generation 314.
	- Examining the final circuits compared to the seed, most of the change happened in the luts of the preexisting register.
- Ran gpio benchmarks, about 25 pulses off at 100khz
## Next
- Analyze evaluation differences between circuits
- Run pulse count accuracy benchmark
- Run experiment without column restraints
