## Log
- Experiment firmware
	- Added pulse counter
	- Made script for interfacing 
	- [Link](https://github.com/heiljj/pico2ice_pulse_count) to repo
- Figuring out asc file integration
	- FileBasedCircuit.\_\_tile_is_included limits tiles logic times available for modification to those with X in [4, 9] and Y in [1, 16]. I'm not quite sure why this is - there are some logic tiles that fall outside of the range.
