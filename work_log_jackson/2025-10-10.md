## Log
- Figuring out more information on logic tile format
	- [[chipdb_logictile]]
	- All of the look up tables are as documented
	- We can find all of the routing information [here](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm/blob/master/icebox/iceboxdb.py#L871)
	- I made a script to parse the logic tile information and filter by entries that evolution can set based on the rows and columns we are mutating, it doesn't look like there are any with the default configuration.
		- What really matters though is if the enable bits are apart of the selected columns. It's still okay if its just limited in the routes that can be selected.
