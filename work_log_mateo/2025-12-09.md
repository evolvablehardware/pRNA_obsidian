## Log
- Researched Labrador hardware
- It is just sending a byte stream of data, so that can be read relatively easily
- I don't think a c++ wrapper is needed for communication
- Coded a basic python script which uses pyusb and reads the byte stream
- it also plots 10ms worth of data, and calculates the fft and uses matplotlib to plot it
- There is a strange bug where every once in a while it reads the max value, so I need to figure out why that is happening
- Calibration is also needed
- Will test potential fitness functions, such as peak frequency, and taking the MSE of each bin, etc.
## Next
- Add the calibration for the Labrador, I will probably need to use known voltages
- I need to figure out the occasionally max voltage readout bug, I should investigate the byte stream further
